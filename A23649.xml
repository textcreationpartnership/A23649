            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>By that able and faithful Servant of Jeſus Chriſt, Mr. <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> late Paſtor of a Church in the City of <hi>Norwich.</hi>

            <head>To the Reader</head>
            <p>HAving a ſight of theſe Sermons before they went to the preſs, I thought fit to ſpeak ſomething of them, and ſomething of the Author.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> As to theſe <hi>Sermons,</hi> The deſign of them is excellent. Firſt, they ſhew that the Holy Ghoſt in bringing Souls to Chriſt, doth firſt convince them of ſin, ſo making them to feel their need of Chriſt, working in them to hunger and thirſt after him, prize him above all, and count all things loſs and dung in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of him. Secondly, In theſe <hi>Sermons</hi> is excellently ſet forth the fulneſs and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> whereby he is able to ſave to the uttermoſt all that come unto God by him. Thirdly, here is ſet forth how freely <hi>Chriſt</hi> admits ſinners to come unto him that they may have life, not ſtanding upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny merit or worthineſs in us, but only works our hearts to a ſenſe of our own vileneſs and unworthineſs, and by a ſecret work of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit draws the humbled and convinced ſinner to take of the water of life freely.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly ſome may meet with a few paſſages in ſome of theſe <hi>Sermons,</hi> that they may not clearly underſtand, Let ſuch conſider that theſe Notes were neither intended nor prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Author for the Preſs, but taken in ſhort hand from the mouth of the Preacher, in
<pb facs="tcp:40096:3"/> which caſe there muſt be great allowance. Likewiſe ſome may think the Author did incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate things too much, and was not ſo conciſe and ſententious as were to be deſired. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that, I would ſay, that in my poor judgment I always looked upon it as one of the many excellent gifts of God beſtowed upon him, that he had a great dexterity in clearing and urging things with variety of expreſſions. As he was a heart Chriſtian, ſo he was a heart Preacher, and thoſe things that are to be wrought upon the hearts of the hearers are to be ſufficientey cleared to their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and earneſtly ſet home to their Souls and Conſciences, though God can ſet in with a ſhort hint to convert a ſoul, and enlarge that with great light and power upon the hearer, that was not ſufficiently cleared and urged by the Preacher, yet truly 'tis an excellence in a Preacher to ſet forth the truths of God plainly and fully with power and authority in the name of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> As to the Author of theſe Sermons, that burning and ſhining light Mr. <hi>Thomas Allen</hi> (now with Chriſt) <hi>I</hi> muſt needs ſay ſomething (having ſuch an opportunity) of the exceeding grace of God in him.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. I</hi> will ſpeak of him <hi>as a Chriſtian.</hi> He was one that obtained mercy to fear the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:40096:3"/> from his youth, and ſoon grew up to ſueh a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace as to be one of the higheſt form in Chriſts ſchool, he attained to be more than one of the children or young men in Chriſt, even to be one of the Fathers, one of the moſt grown and moſt experienced Chriſtians, full of Faith, and of the Holy Ghoſt. His heart was much aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a holy reverence of God, he was a man of a tender conſcience, fearful to offend God, Chriſt was exceeding precious to him, he made him all his ſalvation, and all his deſire, he was full of holy zeal, valiant for the Truth, he had a heart for God, and a tongue for God upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. In communicating to others neceſſities he was ſo free, that uſually he did beyond his eſtate, he was every way eminent in grace, adorning the Goſpel with a holy &amp; fruitful converſaion.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. As a Miniſter,</hi> he was very able and faithful, he was an excellent Preacher, plain and powerful in his doctrine, and though he was a learned man, yet he preached without all oſtentation, he did not confound his hearers with obſcure terms and fantaſtical expreſſions, but endeavoured to ſet forth the Truths of God in the moſt plain and convincing way to the conſciences of men. He preached not himſelf, but Chriſt, he was not deſirous of vain glory. In his preaching he was not in jeſt, playing with his Text and with the ſouls of men (as
<pb facs="tcp:40096:4"/> the manner of ſome is) but was in ſober ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and good earneſt to bring ſouls to Chriſt, and build them up in him. He was eminent in ſelf-denial, he made not the Miniſtry a trade to get mony, his deſign was not to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf rich in the World, but to make others rich in grace. In thoſe places in which he laboured he might ſay with the Apoſtle that he ſought not <hi>theirs,</hi> but <hi>them,</hi> not their <hi>goods,</hi> but their <hi>good.</hi> It's no diſhonour to a Miniſter of Chriſt to live of a little, and to leave but little when he dyes: Proud, lordly, ſelf ſeeking, high living Miniſters no way ſuit the Goſpel of Chriſt; (which was firſt preached by a company of poor men, without any worldly ſplendor, who went through wonderful hardſhips and difficulties in fulfilling the Miniſtry which they received of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>2 Cor. 6.4, 5. 2 Cor. 11, 23, 24,</hi> &amp;c.) but are rather like the Merchants of <hi>Babylon,</hi> who grow rich and great with the abundance of her delicacies, <hi>Rev. 18.3.11.12</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another thing that I would mention of this worthy man was his marvellous condeſcenſion in private diſcourſes to his brethren in the Miniſtry, who were much inferiour to him in age and gifts, not ſtanding upon his own great worth, never exalting himſelf, but preferring them above himſelf, hearing their judgments in any matter with as great reverence and
<pb facs="tcp:40096:4"/> reſpect as if they had been his Superiors. Surely his humility was extraordinary, and a notable example to all that knew him.</p>
            <p>As he was a Scribe inſtructed to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God in all points of the Doctrine of Religion, ſo he was expert in all Queſtions about Church-diſcipline above many; for which he had been much advantaged by living ſo long in <hi>New-England,</hi> and having there ſuch intimate acquaintance with thoſe famous men Mr. <hi>Bulkly,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Shephard,</hi> and others there, who lived in his heart when they were dead, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to ſpeak, and to relate ſome remarkable paſſages of them.</p>
            <p>One thing more I would take notice of in this man of God, he was full of compaſſion to thoſe that were under violent temptations, and terrors of Conſcience, and very judicious to direct them in the way to find reſt unto their ſouls.</p>
            <p>Whil'ſt I commend this Servant of Jeſus Chriſt, let none be offended, as if I thought or ſpake of man above what is meet, I know in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is in theſe days a kind of man-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, a crying up this man and the other, and having their perſons and preaching in admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration without cauſe, when in the mean while who almost cryeth up the Lord Jeſus, and
<pb facs="tcp:40096:5"/> maketh him all in all? Therefore let me be ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in all that I have ſaid, that I mention theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of this Servant of God not to cry up a piece of clay, but for the glory of Chriſt, who put all this treaſure into an earthen veſſel, and to quicken us that are alive and remain to follow ſuch an holy example and pattern as Chriſt hath ſhewn us in his grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon him.</p>
            <p>To conclude, when we have conſidered the graces and excellencies of the Servants of Chriſt, we ſhould turn our eyes preſently to Chriſt himſelf to admire him, and prayſe him. He came from above, and is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, greater than all both men and Angels, We hath a name above every name. The beſt Miniſters muſt decreaſe, go off the ſtage, and ly in the duſt: but he muſt increaſe, and be yet more glorious in the eyes of Angels and men. The beſt Miniſters are but under-ſhepherds to that good, great, chief Shepherd, and Biſhop of our ſouls. It is he that brings the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſons to glory, he is the one Mediator, Saviour, Redeemer, and Head of the Church. Miniſters are but Stewards to this high Lord and King, Labourers for this Lord of the harveſt, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-rowers to Chriſt the Maſter Pilot of the Ship of the Church. Bleſſed are thoſe Servants that are faithful to him our high and moſt excellent Lord Jeſus, our good Lord and Maſter, to whom be glory for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>OUr Lord Jeſus Chriſt is now about to leave the World and to go from his Diſciples and Servants; he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour before his Departure to ſtrengthen and eſtabliſh their hearts both againſt
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40096:6"/> thoſe ſufferings they were like to meet withal, and alſo againſt that ſorrow that now their hearts were filled withall upon the hearing of his depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and going away from them.</p>
               <p>As for their ſufferings you have that ſpoken to in the firſt 4 verſes, wherein he gives them a Reaſon why he ſpeaks to them concerning their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Saith he, <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that you might not be offended.</hi> I tell you before hand of your Sufferings, that you may not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended. What's that? Namely, that you may not be ſo ſtumbled when you meet with Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings more than you did expect, and ſo be ready to turn your backs upon the Goſpel, upon your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you;</hi> He had been ſpeaking in the laſt verſe of the former Chapter, of their meeting with <hi>Tribulation in the the world;</hi> And, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you before-hand, that when they come you might not ſtumble and go back.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee, Brethren, how tender Jeſus Chriſt is of his Diſciples and Servants, he would not have them to be offended, and therefore he tells them before-hand of their Sufferings, and that is the way to prevent Offences, and Stumblings, and fallings back from our Profeſſion by our Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Sufferings, to underſtand and know be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand what we are like to meet withall; and therefore, ſaith Chriſt, I tell you of theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that when they come to paſs, you m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40096:6"/> of the higheſt nature both from the Eccleſiaſtical and Civil State, the higheſt kind of Sufferings they poſſibly can inflict upon you, for, ſaith he, <hi>You ſhall be brought into their Eccleſiaſtical Courts, they ſhall Excommunicate and caſt you out of their Synagogues,</hi> and not only ſo, but you <hi>ſhall have the Cenſure of their Civil Courts,</hi> you ſhall have ſentence of death paſſed upon you, they ſhall put you to death, and think they do God good ſervice in ſo doing. Theſe things, ſaith he, you muſt look for.</p>
               <p>And by the way, take notice of this, That Chriſt and his Servants are expoſed to the greateſt wrath, malice, indignation and hatred that this world can exerciſe on them. The higheſt kinds of evil and puniſhment that this world can infl ct upon them are all little enough; and then he gives the reaſon of it, why they ſhall thus inflict ſuch puniſhments on them, and put them to ſuch ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Verſe</hi> 3. <hi>Theſe things will they do, becauſe they have not known the Father nor me;</hi> It is from their ignorance of God and Chriſt. And truly ſo all Perſecutors, what they do againſt the Saints and People of God, it is from their ignorance of Chriſt; for did they know God and Chriſt, they would not ſo perſecute the Saints and Servants of Chriſt; but theſe things will they do, becauſe they have not known the Father nor me.</p>
               <p>But then the Diſciples might ask Chriſt, Why did he not ſpeak of theſe things before, and tell them what ſufferings they were like to meet with? To that Chriſt anſwers them, <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. <hi>I ſaid not theſe things to you at the beginning, becauſe I was with you.</hi> They were not then ſo liabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40096:7"/> their hatred and malice was then let out againſt Chriſt himſelf, as long as Chriſt was perſonally preſent; ſo the Diſciples were free, Chriſt preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them: but now (ſaith he) I go away, now you ſhall be expoſed to all theſe things, and now I tell you of them, that you may be prepared, ſtrengthened and fortified againſt them.</p>
               <p>But as then for their ſorrow about his going away, he tells them of his going away from them, that they ſhould be deprived of his perſonal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, from <hi>verſe</hi> 5. and ſo on; but now I go my way to him that ſent me. And now Chriſt doth in a very gentle manner blame his Diſciples that they did not enquire into the end and reaſon of his going away, <hi>I go my way to him that ſent me, and none of you ask me, Whither goeſt thou?</hi> If they had but enquired whither Chriſt was to go, and to what end he was to go away from them, their hearts would not have been ſo full of ſorrow, if they had underſtood whither he was going, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he was going to the Father; he was going to Heaven to be glorified there, and exalted there, to ſit at the right hand of God there, to have all power given into his own hand, to have power over all Creatures and things; <hi>None of you ask me, Whither goeſt thou?</hi> Had they enquired after that, had they underſtood that, they would not have been ſo full of ſorrow.</p>

                  <p>But you will ſay, Did not ſome of the Diſciples ask him before, whither he went. <hi>John</hi> 13.36. <hi>Simon Peter ſaid unto him, Lord, whither goeſt thou?</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:40096:7"/> Jeſus anſwered, <hi>Whither I go you cannot follow me now, but you ſhall follow me hereafter — Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>why cannot I follow thee now—?</hi> Why then doth Chriſt ſay here, none of you ask me whither goeſt thou? when <hi>Peter</hi> expreſly asked the Queſtion before.</p>

                  <p>To this I anſwer, <hi>The Queſtion that</hi> Peter <hi>put to Chriſt whither he went, was not ſo much to underſtand his Exaltation and Glory, and the End of his going away, as out of preſidence of his own ſtrength and ability to follow Chriſt:</hi> but now Chriſts meaning is, when he ſaith, <hi>None of you ask me whither goeſt thou?</hi> that is, you do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the end of my going away from you, you do not know wherefore I go to my Father, and therefore Sorrow hath filled your hearts; and then he blames them for being ſo ſad and ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for his going away, <hi>Verſe</hi> 6. <hi>Becauſe I ſaid theſe things to you, Sorrow hath filled your hearts;</hi> if they had known that Chriſt was now going to the Father to be exalted at the right hand of God, they would not have been ſo ſorrowful: no ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14.28. <hi>If ye had loved me, ye would have rejoyced, becauſe I ſaid I go to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for my Father is greater than I.</hi> Now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and take notice of this, <hi>That it is diſpleaſing unto Chriſt to ſee any of his Diſciples and Servants to be immoderately ſorrowfull upon any account;</hi> though it was upon the account of his departing from them and their loſing his Preſence, yet notwithſtanding Chriſt would not have them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately ſorrowful, he blames them for it, and now ſayes he, <hi>becauſe I ſaid theſe things, to you,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40096:8"/> Sorrow hath filled your hearts.</hi> And further, he comes to lay down ſome Comforts and Antidotes againſt their Sorrow here in the Text, the 7th verſe, wherein by way of Comfort he tells them,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it was expedient for them that he ſhould go away, <hi>It is expedient for you;</hi> not only expedient for me that I go to the Father to be exalted in Heaven, <hi>but it is expedient for you alſo,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Expedient for you;</hi> That is one Ground of Comfort to allay their Sorrow. And not only ſo, But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>He doth aſſert it and affirm it very confidently, he would have them fully perſwaded of it;</hi> Becauſe it was hard for them to believe that Chriſt ſhould leave them and go away from them, that they ſhould be deprived of his perſonal preſence; was there any thing harder for them to grapple with than that? could there be any thing more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for them than that he ſhould ſtay with tnem? but ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I tell you the Truth, it is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for you that I go away,</hi> You may be confident and perſwaded of it, <hi>nevertheleſs I tell you the Truth.</hi> And.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He doth further amplify this Comfort about his going away, by telling of them, <hi>What Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit they would have by his going from them,</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that may ſuſtain and ſupport their Hearts and Spirits. Why? what ſhall they get by it? ſaith Chriſt, you ſhall have ſomething that ſhall be equivalent to my bodily preſence, you ſhall have that that is more expedient for you; you ſhall have the preſence of the Comforter the Holy-Ghoſt, and this he doth expreſs both negatively and affirmatively, <hi>If I go not away the Comforter
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40096:8"/> will not come to you, but if I depart I will ſend him unto you:</hi> You ſhall be ſure to have the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter if I go away; when I come to ſit at the right hand of my Father, I will ſend the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter; and you cannot have the Comforter ſo fully now my preſence is with you as you ſhall have after I am aſcended up to Heaven to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. And</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He doth more particularly ſet out the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits they ſhall have by the preſence of the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and amongſt other things he ſaith the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter ſhall be with them to give them ſucceſs in their Miniſtry, ſhall make their Miniſtry effectual and powerful for to convince, <hi>To convince the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the Scope of theſe Words, they are ſpoken by Chriſt by way of Comfort to his Diſciples, whoſe hearts were filled with Sorrow at the hearing of his going away from them. <hi>Nevertheleſs I tell you the Truth, it is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter will not come, but if I depart I will ſend him unto you; and when he is come, he ſhall reprove the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have formerly (as you may remember) ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken concerning the glorious effects of the Goſpel from that Scripture <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. Now here you have laid down the Cauſe whereby the Goſpel came to be ſo efficacious, and effectual, namely, by the preſence of the Comforter, by the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt with the Miniſtry of it.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40096:9"/> You may obſerve and take notice of it, That after Chriſts Aſcenſion into Heaven, immediately their Miniſtry was more powerfull and more effectual in one Sermon, than it was in all the time they were with Chriſt in his bodily preſence, three thouſand at one Clap were brought in by one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, ſo powerful was the Holy Ghoſt with them in their Miniſtry. But briefly then, before I come to ſpeak to the eighth Verſe (which principally I aimed at in pitching upon this Scripture) I ſhall take up one Note or Obſervation, which may be of Uſe and Concernment to us, from the 7th <hi>verſe;</hi> and that is this,
<q>
                        <hi>Doct.</hi> That it is a moſt certain Truth that it is expedient for the Diſciples and Servants of Chriſt ſometimes to be deprived of the neareſt and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Comforts that they have in this World.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Brethren, the Preſence of Chriſt was the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and deareſt Comfort that they had in this World, yet ſaith Chriſt, <hi>It is expedient for you that I go away from you, and that you be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of my bodily Preſence;</hi> and becauſe it was a hard thing for them to believe; what? to be deprived of his Preſence that was ſo dear to them: therefore he adds this, <hi>I tell you the Truth;</hi> it is true what I ſay, it is no Lye. <hi>Nevertheleſs, I tell you the Truth, it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for you that I go away.</hi> It was expedient that Chriſt ſhould go away, and lay down his Life, that he ſhould riſe again from the dead, and aſcend into Heaven, and ſit on the right hand of God, and have all Power and Glory
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40096:9"/> put into his hand, and therefore it was expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for them, that they might enjoy all the Fruits of his Death, and Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion, and Glorification, and Exaltation; it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for them in all theſe reſpects, but more particularly that they might have the Holy Ghoſt ſent down to them.</p>
                  <p>Me-thinks, Brethren, Jeſus Chriſt here comes to his Diſciples and ſpeaks to them as a tender-hearted Husband to his dear Wife, when he is about to undertake ſome great Journey, or ſome Voyage, to go away from her, ſhe is mourning and weeping, he comes and ſpeaks comfortably to her, and perſwades her to be of good chear, as if he ſhould ſay, <hi>My Deare, there is no Remedy, I muſt go away, I muſt take this Journey, there is no help for it, 'tis neceſſary, 'tis expedient, nay, and 'tis for thy ſake, it is to fetch in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts for thee, and neceſſaries for thee; it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient not only for me to finiſh my Buſineſs becauſe my occaſions and buſineſs call me abroad, but it is expedient for thee that I take this Voyage or Journey, 'tis for your Comfort; and be aſſured of it, that I will ſend to you ere long, thou ſhalt hear from me ere long, I will ſend One on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to comfort thee and refreſh thee in my abſence; and know this that I will not ſtay always from you, but will come in a ſhort time again.</hi> Thus Jeſus Chriſt ſpake to his Diſciples, when he was about to leave them, ſaith he, My occaſions call me to go away from you, and not only ſo, but it is expedient for you, it is for your Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and Advantage, and though I be perſonally abſent from you, yet I will ſend one unto you
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40096:10"/> that ſhall ſupply my abſence, even the Comforter, and after a little ſhort time I will come again to you, I will not ſtay long from you; ſo he ſaith afterwards, <hi>Verſe</hi> 16. <hi>A little while and you ſhall not ſee me, and a little while and you ſhall ſee me, becauſe I go to the Father.</hi> And <hi>Verſe</hi> 22. <hi>Therefore now have you Sorrow; but I will ſee you again, and your hearts ſhall rejoyce:</hi> Within a little while I will come to you, I will make all the haſte I can to you. Thus Chriſt ſpeaks to his Diſciples and Servants to comfort their Hearts, being ſorrowfull upon his going away.</p>
                  <p>Brethren, Was there any thing, or could there be any thing that was nearer or dearer to the hearts of the Diſciples than the preſence of Chriſt? The preſence of Jeſus Chriſt was more to them than any Comforts of this World, more to them than their Eſtates and Callings, and Gain, and Trade, for you know they left their Ships and their Nets and Callings and all to follow Chriſt; nay Chriſt was more near and dear to them than their neareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations that they had in the World, for 'tis ſaid, they left not only their Callings, their Trades and Ships and Nets, but they left their Fathers and away they went after Chriſt, yea they left all that ever they had, as <hi>Peter</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaith, <hi>Matthew</hi> 19.27, 28, 29. ſaith he, <hi>We have left all to follow thee;</hi> Not only their Callings, their Trade and Gains, not only their Parents and Relations, <hi>But we have left All to follow thee;</hi> Yea, Brethren, Jeſus Chriſt was more
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40096:10"/> dear and precious to them than their very lives, for you know what Chriſt was ſpeaking to them about his going away, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. and telling them that ſome of them would deny him, ſaith <hi>Peter, Though I dy with thee, I will not deny thee;</hi> ſaith he, I will dy firſt, I will loſe my life firſt, and 'tis ſaid all of them ſaid after the like manner; they loved Chriſt more than their very lives, and yet now you ſee what Chriſt ſaid to them, though his Preſence was ſo near and dear unto them, yet ſaith Chriſt, I tell you the Truth it is expedient for you that I go away, it is expedient for you that I leave you, though I be ſo near and dear unto you. So that here is the Point grounded upon theſe Words; That it is a moſt certain Truth, <hi>That it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the Diſciples and Servants of Chriſt ſometimes to be deprived of thoſe Comforts that ſeem to be neareſt and deareſt to them in this World,</hi> it is expedient for them—: <hi>The Word that is here tranſlated expedient, it ſignifieth moſt profitable, more profitable for you, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for you;</hi> better for you that I go away, than that I ſtay with you; more Profitable for you, ſo the Word is ſometimes tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſo it properly ſignifieth, expedient, that is, profitable: ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> 6.12. <hi>All things are lawfull for me, but all things are not expedient.</hi> The Word is <hi>profitable,</hi> ſo it is in the Margin, <hi>All things are not profitable.</hi> So <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. in the laſt <hi>Verſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Even as I pleaſe all Men in all things, not ſeeking mine own profit, but the profit of many that they may be ſaved,</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:40096:11"/> it is the ſame word, only tis there tranſlated <hi>profit,</hi> or <hi>profitable;</hi> 'tis expedient or profitable for you that I go away; and ſometimes 'tis tranſlated <hi>good</hi> or <hi>better,</hi> ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 17.2, 3. Saith Chriſt, <hi>It were better for him that a Mill-ſtone were hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about his neck, and he caſt into the Sea, than that he ſhould offend one of theſe little ones;</hi> The word is, <hi>expedient.</hi> So again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.29, 30. Saith Chriſt, <hi>'Tis better for you to go into Life mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, with one Eye, or one Hand, than having both your Eyes and hands, to go into Hell.</hi> 'Tis <hi>better,</hi> the word is, <hi>expedient.</hi> So that here is the meaning of it; <hi>It is expedient for you that I go away,</hi> that is, <hi>'tis moſt profitable for you, 'tis better for you</hi> that I go away from you, than that you do enjoy my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal preſence.</p>
                  <p>Now for the opening and handling of this Point and Truth, I ſhall briefly ſpeak to theſe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Give you the Demonſtrations of it, by ſome particular Inſtances, <hi>That it is moſt expedient or profitable ſometimes for the Servants of Chriſt to be deprived of their neareſt and deareſt Comforts that they do enjoy.</hi> In which I ſhall give you ſome particulars.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſhall ſhew the Ground why, or whereupon <hi>It is ſo expedient or profitable for them to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their deareſt and neareſt Comforts they can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in this World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And then ſhew you this, <hi>That to enjoy the preſence of the Comforter, the Spirit of God, is more expedient for the Saints in this World, than to enjoy the perſonal preſence of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:40096:11"/>
                  <p>I ſhall not be able to go through this Point at this time; but for the</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To give you ſome Demonſtrations by ſome particular Inſtances, <hi>That it is expedient for the Servants of Chriſt ſometimes to be deprived of their neareſt and deareſt Comforts that they have in this World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall Inſtance now in ſome particulars. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It may be expedient for the Servants of Chriſt ſometimes to be deprived of their outward Eſtates in the World.</hi> Brethren, to have a competent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Eſtate in the World is a comfortable thing; Thoſe that have great Eſtates, do not know and underſtand the temptations of a poor eſtate; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſaith the holy man <hi>Agur, Pro.</hi> 30.9. though he would not be rich, yet, <hi>Lord give me not poverty.</hi> It is a great mercy to be comfortably provided for in the World, yet for all that it is moſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſometimes for the ſervants of Chriſt to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their outward Eſtates in the world. You know how it was with <hi>Job,</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>He was the richeſt man in all the Eaſt; he had ſeven thouſand Sheep, three thouſand Camels, a thouſand yoke of Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, five hundred ſhe-Aſſes,</hi> Job 10.3. yet it was expedient for <hi>Job</hi> to be deprived of all this Eſtate, all was taken from him ſuddenly, and it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for him thus to be deprived. If his Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel could have ſpoke they would have ſaid, as Chriſt to his Diſciples here; his Sheep would have ſaid, <hi>It is expedient for you, that we go away from you;</hi> his Oxen, his Camels and his Aſſes, all would have ſaid, <hi>It is expedient for you, for us to go away from you.</hi> We read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. That the Chriſtians in thoſe dayes were plundred of their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40096:12"/> Eſtates in this World, and it was expedient for them, becauſe <hi>God hath provided a better and more enduring ſubſtance for them.</hi> And therefore mark the expreſſion of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> 1.10. <hi>Let the Brother of low degree rejoyce in that he is exalted; but the rich in that he is made low,</hi> becauſe 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for him. That is one thing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us inſtance in <hi>Outward Accommodations.</hi> As now, to be comfortably provided for in reſpect of Clothing, and in reſpect of an Habitation, and Dwelling-place. Brethren, theſe are great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, to be left naked in the time of the Cold, to be without Clothing is a great Suffering, to be left without a Houſe and Habitation, to be driven by Enemies from our Houſes and Habitations, to be forced to flee up and down into the naked fields, 'tis a great Affliction: but it is a great Comfort and Bleſſing to be well provided for for Clothing and Habitation; I do not ſpeak in regard of gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Apparrel, but for neceſſary and convenient Clothing; <hi>Let thy Garments be always white,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon;</hi> hanſome Clothing, cleanly Clothing, is a great mercy and comfort. Yet now ſometimes, it is expedient for the ſervants of Chriſt to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their Clothing, to be put to their ſhifts to get any raggs to cover their nakedneſs; you ſhall read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37. how thoſe <hi>Worthies, of whom the World was not worthy, they wandred up and down in Sheep-skins and Goat-skins, being deſtitute, afflicted and tormented;</hi> They were deprived of their Clothing they could take up a skin that they found in the Wilderneſs, and were glad to make uſe of it to cover their Bodies; they were covered with Sheep-skins and Goat-skins. So for a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40096:12"/> it is a comfortable thing to have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Habitation and Dwelling-place, to ſhelter them from the Weather; and therefore 'tis made as a gracious promiſe, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 11.11. <hi>That God's People ſhall dwell in their own Houſes.</hi> I tell you, if ſo be we had an enemy to come and drive us out of our Houſes and take poſſeſſion of our Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, whilſt we eſcape with our Lives, it would be a great affliction; but yet for all that, ſometimes it is moſt expedient for the Lords Servants to be deprived of their Habitations. Look into <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.38. You read of thoſe, of <hi>whom the World was not worthy, That they wandred in Deſarts, and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and Dens, and Caves of the Earth;</hi> they had no Houſes at all, that if they could find out a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hole in the Wilderneſs and Deſart, if they could find out a Cave, they would be glad to hide their heads there; the Lord ſaw it expedient for them that their Houſes and Habitations, and alſo their outward accommodations in regard of Cloathing, ſhould be taken from them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To inſtance <hi>in our Liberties.</hi> Liberty, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren is a great bleſſing, it is a great mercy to have Liberty, that we are not in Enemies hands, that we are not clapt up in cloſe Priſons, that we are not in Chains; and thoſe that have had experience, what it is to be deprived of their Liberty, that have been clapt up in Priſon, they are better able to judge of it than we are, what a Mercy Liberty is; thoſe that are now in Priſon for their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, would prize their Liberty if they might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it. Well, but yet for all this, that Liberty is ſuch a great mercy and bleſſing, yet ſometimes it

                  <p n="5">5. To give another Inſtance, <hi>To inſtance in near Relations,</hi> as to enjoy the comfort of Yoke-fellows, to enjoy the comforts of Children, Chriſtian-friends and acquaintance, theſe are great Comforts and great Bleſſings. As I remember the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 128.3, 4. He is ſpeaking what a mercy and bleſſing it is to enjoy Children, <hi>Thy Children ſhall be like Olive Plants round about thy Table; and thus ſhall the Man be bleſſed that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Lord.</hi> And ſaith <hi>Solomon, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.9. <hi>Live joyfully with the Wife whom thou loveſt, all the days of the life of thy vanity.</hi> Theſe things are great Comforts; But yet it is expedient ſometimes for the Servants of Chriſt to be deprived of theſe Comforts, for Children to be deprived of Parents, and for Parents to be deprived of Children, which are accounted by Parents ſomtimes their deareſt Comforts in this World, yet God ſees it expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for them ſometimes to be deprived of them by Death. <hi>Son of Man,</hi> ſaith God, to <hi>Ezech.</hi> 24.16. <hi>Behold, I will take away the deſire of thine Eyes with a ſtroke;</hi> that is, his Wife, <hi>and ſhe died in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Sometimes ſome are taken away by ſome ſuddain accident, as all <hi>Jobs</hi> Children were, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they are deprived of them by Perſecution, they are made to forſake Father and Mother, Wife and Children, and all for Chriſt's ſake. <hi>We have forſaken all,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. latter end. And ſometimes they are deprived of the Comforts of them by having their Affections from them, as <hi>Job</hi> complains of the Wife of his boſom, that <hi>ſhe was a ſtranger to him.</hi> And the <hi>Pſalmiſt,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40096:14"/> Pſal.</hi> 88.8.

Saith <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 12.12. <hi>I have eſteemed the words of his mouth more than my neceſſary food;</hi> He had rather loſe his meat and drink than miſs of the Word of God. And, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 122.1. <hi>I was glad when they ſaid unto me, Come, let us go up to the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> The Ordinances of the Lord, they are and ought to be dear unto all the Saints and Servants of God, yet for all that I may ſay, it is expedient ſometimes for the Servants of Chriſt to be deprived of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt. <hi>David</hi> found this by experience, he was deprived of the Ordinances, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.4. ſaith he, <hi>When I remember theſe things, I pour out
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40096:15"/> my ſoul in me; for I had gone with the multitude; I went with them to the Houſe of God, with the voice of joy and praiſe;</hi> but now, ſaith he, <hi>My ſoul is caſt down;</hi> And ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1. ſaith he, <hi>I dwell in a dry and thirſty Land, where no water is.</hi> He meant where there are no Ordinances; He could not wait upon God in his Ordinances; It was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for <hi>David</hi> to be deprived of the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. I remember a paſſage of the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. ſaith ſhe, <hi>By night on my Bed, I ſought him whom my ſoul loveth, I ſought him, but I found him not.</hi> She could not find Chriſt, ſhe could not enjoy the Ordinances of Chriſt, nor Chriſt in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and truly this hath been, and may be the caſe of the dear Servants of Chriſt, to be deprived of the Ordinances, that are near and dear to them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.37, 38. You ſee there how thoſe <hi>of whom the world was not worthy,</hi> that they were glad to ſhift for their lives, to run up and down in Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and Caves, and Dens of the Earth to hide themſelves, and ſo were deprived of Ordinances and Communion with Saints; and it was expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for them.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. To inſtance in another thing yet higher, <hi>'Tis expedient ſometimes for the Saints and Servants of Chriſt to be deprived of Communion with Chriſt in holy Duties and Ordinances.</hi> I may ſay in this caſe (becauſe poſſibly it is not eaſy to be believed) as Chriſt ſaid to the Diſciples in the Text, Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, I tell you the truth, 'tis ſometimes expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the Saints and Servants of Chriſt to be deprived of Communion with Chriſt in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances, though this is moſt dear and precious to them. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.24. ſaith God, <hi>In all places where
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40096:15"/> my Name ſhall be recorded, thither will I come, and meet with my People, and bleſs them;</hi> that is, in his Ordinances, where his Name is recorded; and I ſay, ſometimes it is expedient even for the very Saints and Servants of Chriſt to be deprived of the preſence of Chriſt in his Ordinances, of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Chriſt in his Ordinances, ſometimes not to ſee Chriſt, nor to meet with Chriſt in holy Duties and Ordinances. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. <hi>By night on my Bed,</hi> ſaith the Spouſe, <hi>I ſought him whom my ſoul loveth, I ſought him, but I found him not; By night on my Bed I ſought him,</hi> I ſought him in the Ordinances, that is the Bed where Chriſt hath Communion with his Saints and Servants, yet ſaith the Spouſe, <hi>I ſought him on my Bed, but found him not.</hi> And I remember <hi>Job</hi> hath an expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Chap.</hi> 23.8, 9. <hi>Behold I go forward, but he is not there, and backward but I cannot perceive him, on the left hand where he doth work, but I cannot behold him; he hideth himſelf on the right hand that I cannot ſee him;</hi> Saith <hi>Job</hi> I went forward, and I went backward, I went from Ordinance to Ordinance, but I found him not. The Lord may ſee this expedient for his dear Servants and Children even to be deprived of Communion with himſelf, in his own Inſtitutions, which is hard to be believed, yet, nevertheleſs I tell you the Truth it is expedient for you that the Lord do with-hold his Preſence ſometimes from his own Ordinances to his own Servants. Yet once more.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Eightly and laſtly, which is ſtill yet higher, <hi>It may be expedient ſometimes for the Saints and Servants of Chriſt to be deprived of ſeeing the face
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40096:16"/> of God, and enjoying the Senſe of Gods favour,</hi> which in Truth is the moſt deſirable thing in the World, it is e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>en a Heaven upon Earth, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Heaven to ſee the face of God, and to enjoy the ſence of the favour and loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God. Saith <hi>David, In thy favour is life;</hi> my life lay in that, nay ſaith he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Thy Loving-kindneſs is better than Life,</hi> and yet I tell you, ſometimes it is expedient for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God to be deprived even of the ſence of the favour and loving-kindneſs of God, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Lord ſees it expedient for him to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in that ſence; and therefore you find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times how <hi>David</hi> complains, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13.1, 2. <hi>How long O Lord, how long wilt thou hide thy face from mee? for ever?</hi> And ſo, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.8. <hi>For a little moment I hid my face from thee</hi>— It was expedient for them that God did with-hold or hide his face, or the ſenſe of his Loving-kindneſs from them. Nay, Brethren, ſhall I ſay further, if it were poſſible for a Saint to enjoy or to ſee the face of God in Heaven, as the Angels and Saints do, yet as long as they are upon the Earth, it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſometimes for them to be deprived of that too. You know <hi>Moſes</hi> was in the Mount with God, but it was expedient for <hi>Moſes</hi> to come down from the Mount again, ſo long as he was clothed with fleſh; it was expedient for <hi>Moſes</hi> to come out from the immediate Preſence of God. And you know what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith; <hi>That he was wrapt up into the third Heavens, and ſaw things unlawfull and impoſſible to utter,</hi> yet it was expedient for <hi>Paul</hi> that he ſhould be deprived of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40096:16"/> ſeeing and enjoying that Viſion till he came to lay down the body.</p>
                  <p>And thus now you have ſeen the firſt thing propounded. The Demonſtrations of this Truth by ſome particular Inſtances, <hi>That it is expedient ſometimes for the Saints and Servants of Chriſt to be deprived of thoſe Comforts that are neareſt and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to them in the World;</hi> as Chriſt tells his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples here, <hi>Nevertheleſs I tell you the Truth, it is expedient for you that I go away,</hi> that they ſhould be deprived of his perſonal Preſence.</p>
                  <p>I had intended to have gone on further, to have made it appear to you by the grounds of it. There are five or ſix Grounds whereby it doth certainly appear that it is moſt expedient ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the Servants of Chriſt to be deprived of their neareſt and deareſt Comforts they have in the World, and then to come to the third thing, but I would not willingly treſpaſſe, only remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this, every one of you here before the Lord, We do not know how ſoon any of us may be deprived of thoſe things that are looked upon as our neareſt and deareſt Comforts, when it comes to be our lot; remember what Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It is expedient for you that I go away,</hi> it is expedient for you to be deprived of this and the other Comfort, of your Eſtates, of your Accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Liberty, and Ordinances; and though now you may enjoy Communion with God, yet it may be expedient for you to be deprived of it; remember that. And if any of you be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of your near Relations, as Children,—
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40096:17"/> remember what Chriſt hath here ſpoken, <hi>It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for you that I go away,</hi> it is expedient for you that the Lord hath taken away ſuch a Child, ſuch a Son, or ſuch a Daughter; though it be an only Child, yet it is expedient for you that it be taken away. But I would not proceed any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at preſent.</p>

Expedient! they thought it was impoſſible; How could that be? What? To loſe the Bodily preſence of Chriſt, to be deprived of that!

               <p>Jeſus Chriſt his preſence was moſt dear and precious to the Diſciples; there was nothing in the World more dear and precious to them, they would have laid down their lives for him, not only <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid ſo, but ſo ſaid all the Diſciples; now yet Chriſt told them, it was expedient for them that he ſhould go away. I gave you the Demonſtrations of this Point the laſt time. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced in 7 or 8 things, wherein it was ſometimes expedient for the Saints and Servants of Chriſt to be deprived of their neareſt and deareſt Comforts in this Life, which I ſhall not now mention, becauſe I would finiſh this Point at this time.</p>

                  <head>II</head>
                  <p>I ſhall now proceed to the ſecond thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, which, is to give the Grounds and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of it, Why it is expedient for the Saints and Servants of Chriſt thus to be deprived ſometimes of their neareſt and deareſt Comforts in this World; This is a hard ſaying, the Diſciples were hard to believe it, that it could be expedient for them that Chriſt ſhould go away from them. And ſo for a Soul to be deprived of the Light of Gods Countenance, that they cannot meet with God in
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40096:19"/> holy Duties and Ordinances, theſe are hard things to believe, that they can be expedient for them. Now to give you ſome Reaſons, why it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſometimes for the Saints and Servants of Chriſt to be deprived of their neareſt and deareſt Comforts in this World.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though they cannot think ſo, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, <hi>Becauſe their Heavenly Father knows it to be expedient for them.</hi> Their heavenly Father, who is infinitely wiſe and infinitely loving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, he knows that thoſe things are expedient for them in this Life: you that are Parents, you know what is more expedient for your Children than they do themſelves; Alas! if Children were left to their own judgments, they would judge thoſe things expedient for them that are not expedient; they would judge it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them, to take their own liberty, and to do their own Wills, and that it were more expedient for them to be playing, than to go to School; ſo they would judge it expedient for them never to be put out to Apprenticeſhip, to be Servants, to go from their Fathers houſe; they think it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them to be always at home, under their Parents wing: but you that are Parents know what is more expedient for your Children than they do themſelves; and when they come to grow up then they will be ready to ſay, That their Fathers did judge better for them than they could have judged for themſelves; then they will ſay, If I had been left to mine own Judgment what was expedient for me then, I had not had this bringing up and Education that I have; nay then they may think that it
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40096:20"/> was expedient for them, that they were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times under the Rod. Truly Brethren, the Lord our Heavenly Father is infinitely wiſe, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to all his Children, he knows what is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for them better than they do. Chriſt knew that his going away from his Diſciples, was more expedient for them, than they themſelves could judge of it: ſo our heavenly Father knows that ſometimes it is beſt for us to be deprived of our neareſt and deareſt Relations in the World; your Heavenly Father knows that you have need of theſe things, and he knows that ſometimes you have need to be deprived of them. That is the firſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is expedient ſometimes for the Saints and Servants of Chriſt to be deprived of their neareſt and deareſt Comforts; <hi>Becauſe ſometimes the Lord takes away one Comfort, and gives them that in ſtead of it that is far better for them.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as Chriſt ſaith in the Text, <hi>it is expedient for you that I go away:</hi> why how can that be? It is more expedient for you, for you ſhall have the Holy Ghoſt, the Holy Spirit, I will ſend the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter to you, and that is better for you. He would give them the preſence of his Spirit in ſtead of his own bodily preſence, and that was better for them. Sometimes the Lord takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way one Comfort, and gives another inſtead of it, that is moſt expedient for us; as it is ſaid, he removed the former Covenant, and that was done away, that ſo he might bring in a New Covenant in the ſtead of it, which was far better; the Old was done away, to make way for the New. God took away the child from <hi>David,</hi> that was begotten
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40096:20"/> in Adultery, and gave him a <hi>Solomon;</hi> ſo God deales ſometimes with his Children, he takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſometimes their outward Eſtates in the World, to give them a larger, an heavenly and ſpiritual Eſtate, to give them more of the true Riches; he takes away their outward Liberty, that they may have more ſpiritual Enlargment: thus many times the Lord deals with his Diſciples and Servants, he takes away one mercy from them, which they think to be moſt expedient, and gives them another, which he knows to be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for them. Therefore I remember <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaid to his Brethren, when he ſent from <hi>Egypt</hi> to them to come from the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Leave your Stuff behind you; you ſhall have that that is better for you than your Stuff, for all the good of the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>is before you.</hi> Thus the Lord makes an exchange, if he calls us to leave one Comfort, he intends to beſtow a better Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort upon us; thus it was with theſe Diſciples. But,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Sometimes the Lord takes away our neareſt and deareſt Comforts we have in the World in way of Correction and Chaſtiſement;</hi> to correct and chaſtiſe his people for their wantonneſs, for their forgetfulneſs of him, for their ſitting looſe from him, and living even as it were without God in the World, when the Lord ſees that his Children do make a bad uſe of their Comforts and Mercies; the Lord is pleaſed to take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them; juſt as you that are Parents deal by your Children; if you ſee they go about to cut their fingers with the knife, you take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the knife from them; if they do waſte and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40096:21"/> deſtroy their meat, you take away their meat from them; thus the Lord deals with his Children; he ſees his Children grow wanton, and careleſs, and forgetfull of God, then the Lord is pleaſed to take his Rod and correct them, by taking away their Comforts that are neareſt and deareſt to them. As now again for Parents, you ſee Parents when their Children grow forgetful of them, and do not mind what they ſay to them, and do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their Commands, then their Parents will be ready to take away from them that which they know to be neareſt and deareſt to them, by way of Correction. Thus the Lord is pleaſed to deal with his own Children, if he ſee they be perverſe and diſobedient, and careleſs, and rebellious, — It is juſt with the Lord then, in a way of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Chaſtiſemnet, to take thoſe mercies from them that he ſees to be moſt near and dear to them: and the Lord doth it out of mercy and love to his Children, in depriving them of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mercies, to deprive them of Health, and Strength, and Eſtate, and ſometimes of their near Relations, by way of Chaſtiſement, leſt they ſhould be condemned with the world; they would run upon their own ruine elſe, if the Lord let them alone. The Apoſtle gives the reaſon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. why ſo many were ſick, and weak, and fallen aſleep, ſaith he, <hi>When ye are judged, ye are chaſtened of the Lord, that ye might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the World.</hi> And ſo the Lord is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deal with his own Children and Servants, he deprives them of their neareſt and deareſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in the World, by way of Chaſtiſement and Correction; therefore ſometimes he hides his face
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40096:21"/> from them, and many times takes his Ordinances from them, and if they do enjoy Ordinances, he with-holds his gracious preſence from them, that they ſhall not ſee his Face in this and that Duty and Ordinance; and this the Lord doth by way of Chaſtiſement.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Lord doth ſometimes deprive his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of their neareſt and deareſt Comforts in this World, <hi>Becauſe he will bring them thereby to be pliable to his own Will, and train them up in a courſe of Obedience to his own Will.</hi> Look now, as Parents that they may train up their Children to be obedient to them in every thing, to be at their beck, ſometimes they will take away from them that which is neareſt and deareſt to them; Give me that thing, and I muſt have ſuch a thing, will a wiſe Father ſay ſometimes to a Child, to train him up in a way of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his Fathers will. So the Lord deals with his own Children, when he ſees we have this or that Comfort which is near or dear to us. Now that God may train us up to his own Will, and that we may learn ſubjection to his Will, the Lord calls for this Comfort and that mercy, that is ſo dear to us, that Yoke-fellow, and that Child, or whoever it be that is near and dear to us; the Lord doth ſometimes call it from us, and take it away, that we may learn to be ſubmiſſive to his Will; as it is ſaid concerning Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.8. <hi>That Chriſt learned Obedience by his Sufferings,</hi> and truly ſo when Chriſt came to drink the Cup that his Father put into his hand, ſaith he, <hi>The Cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> He learned Obedience by his
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40096:22"/> Sufferings; and ſo the Lord may teach his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren Obedience by training them up in this way, to take away their neareſt and deareſt Comforts from them that they may come to be at the Lords will and word in every thing. And thus the Lord trained up <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaith God to <hi>Abraham,</hi> I muſt have you to go out of your own Country, to leave your Friends and Relations behind, to go into a ſtrange place, and <hi>Abraham</hi> did ſo; And then when the Lord had given him an only and a beloved Son, ſaith God to him, Come I muſt take that Son from you, go and Sacrifice him your ſelf to me; thus God trained up <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to his foot (as it were) which is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.2. <hi>Abraham</hi> was brought to the foot of God, to the beck of God. Thus God deals with his Children, he trains them up to be ſubmiſſive to his own will, to his ordering, for every thing, therefore God will ſometimes take away this Comfort and that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, though never ſo near and dear to us. That is the fourth Reaſon.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Lord doth ſometimes deprive his Children of their neareſt and deareſt Comforts, <hi>That they may learn to fear before him,</hi> that they may ſtand in awe of him, as it is ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.19. Becauſe they are in no change, therefore they fear not God, they meet with no changes, they have their wills, and they enjoy their Comforts here in the World; and becauſe they have no changes, therefore they fear not God. And truly the Lords own people are apt to grow ſecure in time of Proſperity when they meet with few changes, they are apt to grow ſecure. It was
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40096:22"/> 
                     <hi>Davids caſe, Pſal.</hi> 30.5, 6, <hi>I ſaid in my proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity I ſhall never be moved.</hi> And ſo I remember <hi>Job</hi> hath ſuch an expreſſion, <hi>Chap.</hi> 29.18. <hi>I ſaid I ſhall dye in my Neſt—;</hi> His neſt was feathered round about him, he was comfortably ſupplyed with all manner of Neceſſaries and comforts in this Life, and ſaith he, <hi>I began to grow ſecure, I ſaid I ſhould dye in my Neſt;</hi> And therefore the Lord is pleaſed to bring Changes upon his People, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake them out of their ſecurity, to cauſe them more to fear God, and to acknowledge their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance upon God, to fear that God, that is able to bring great Changes upon them, to fear him that is able to take away their neareſt and deareſt Comforts. Thus the Lord deals with his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to train and nurture them up in his fear.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And Laſtly. The Lord does ſometimes deal thus with his own Children, to deprive them of their neareſt and deareſt Comforts that they have in this Life, <hi>That ſo he may make them to look more after a Heavenly Inheritance, that ſhall never be taken from them;</hi> where there ſhall be no Changes, where they ſhall be paſt all fear of ever being deprived of any comfort they ſhall enjoy. Therefore 'tis ſaid of the Patriarchs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.14, 16. 'Tis ſaid in the 13th <hi>Verſe,</hi> They confeſſed, <hi>That they were Strangers and Pilgrims on the Earth,</hi> for they that ſay ſuch things, declare plainly <hi>That they ſeek a Country</hi> but now they deſire a better Country, which is, <hi>an Heavenly</hi> — They are Strangers and Pilgrims in the World, they meet with great Changes in the World, and therefore ſay they, <hi>We are Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and Pilgrims;</hi> we are going to a Country
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40096:23"/> where there ſhall be no change. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.34. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of thoſe that were exerciſed with changes, that they had their Eſtates taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and were plundred of all that they had, they made nothing of that; becauſe <hi>they had an eye to the recompence of reward,</hi> the inheritance of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that made them look for a heavenly Country, becauſe then they ſhould be paſt all chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, there ſhould be no plundering there, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation of any Comfort that they there ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, that is an Inheritance that is incorruptible and undefiled, that fadeth not away; there ſhall be no changes throughout all Eternity. And thus now you have ſeen the Reaſons and Grounds of the Point, That it is expedient ſometimes for the Saints and Diſciples of Chriſt to be deprived of their neareſt and deareſt Comforts that they do enjoy in this World.</p>
               </div>

                  <head>III.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. But to come to <hi>the Third thing</hi> propounded, and that is, <hi>to ſhew, That the Enjoyment of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, the preſence of the Spirit is more expedient for the Saints and Diſciples of Chriſt, than to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the bodily Preſence of Chriſt himſelf.</hi> For ſo Chriſt intimates here to his Diſciples, ſaith he, <hi>It is expedient for you that I go away,</hi> that you be deprived of my bodily Preſence, for then you ſhall have the Comforter, the Spirit; if I go not away the Comforter will not come; therefore it is more expedient for them to have the Preſence of the Spirit, than to enjoy the bodily Preſence of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Truly Brethren, as long as Chriſt was with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40096:23"/> them in the fleſh, they could not expect to have ſuch a communication of the Spirit, as they ſhould have when Chriſt was taken from them. When Chriſt was taken from them, when he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended up to Heaven, then the Spirit was to be given down; And that is given by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, <hi>John</hi> 7.37, 38, 39. as a Reaſon, why the Spirit was not yet given to them: They had ſome drops of the Spirit, They had not the pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Spirit, becauſe, ſaith he, <hi>Verſe</hi> 39. <hi>Jeſus was not yet glorified;</hi> he had ſaid, <hi>verſe</hi> 38. <hi>That, he that believeth on me, out of his belly ſhall flow Rivers of living Water; but this he ſpake of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, for the Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe that Jeſus was not yet glorified.</hi> No, they could not expect the pourings out of the Spirit, till Jeſus Chriſt had left the World, and was gone into Heaven. For Brethren, when Jeſus Chriſt aſcended up to Heaven, then the Father made him welcome, and ſat him down at his own right hand in glory, he gave him the higheſt place of Dignity in Heaven, all power in Heaven and Earth was put into his Hands, and he gave him the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or Giving out of the Spirit, the giving out of the gifts of the Spirit; For ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. <hi>When he aſcended up on high, then he received the Spirit,</hi> and the gifts of the Spirit to be given out to his people; This is the Reward that God the Father gave to Chriſt, after his great labour and ſuffering in the World, aſſoon as ever he came into Heaven: God exalted him with this Exaltation, and then he gave him the fulneſs of the Spirit, to give out when he would,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40096:24"/> therefore aſſoon as Chriſt aſcended up to Heaven, preſently after there was an abundant pouring out of the Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. You know the Holy Ghoſt fell down upon the Diſciples like fiery cloven tongues, and then they ſpake with tongues, they were able to ſpeak in every mans Language; and then you ſee the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> made a Speech to them that heard it, and wondred at it, <hi>Verſe</hi> 33. and ſaith he, This is the Fruit and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Chriſts Aſcenſion into Heaven. <hi>Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received of the Father, the Promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt, he hath ſhed forth this, which you now ſee and hear.</hi> Chriſt leaving the World, and being exalted in Heaven, he had this power to give out the Spirit, and ſaith he, this is the Fruit of it, <hi>He hath ſhed forth this, which you now ſee and hear;</hi> Therefore if Chriſt had not left the Diſcipies, then the Diſciples, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt, had been deſtitute of the pourings out of the Spirit upon them. It is true indeed, it cannot be denyed but the enjoyment of Chriſts bodily preſence, was a moſt deſirable thing, very deſirable to enjoy the bodily preſence of Jeſus Chriſt, to ſee God in our fleſh. I remember <hi>Job</hi> did rejoyce in it, in the hopes of it, many hundreds and ſome thouſands of yeares beforehand, in the midſt of his great Troubles and Afflictions, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.25, 26, 27. ſaith he, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth, and with theſe eyes I ſhall ſee him;</hi> And this was matter of Comfort to him many hundreds of years before hand, in the midſt of thoſe Sufferings and Troubles he met
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40096:24"/> withall, that he ſhould ſee his Redeemer with his Eyes in the fleſh. And Brethren, the ſight of Chriſt in the fleſh, it is a ſight that is matter of Admiration to the very Angels in Heaven; <hi>God manifeſt in the fleſh, ſeen of Angels,</hi> it was to the Admiration of Angels, worth their looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1 <hi>Timothy</hi> 3.16. <hi>Great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſt in the Fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels;</hi> it was a great ſight to the glorious Angels, they deſired to pry into that great Myſtery; and it was one of holy <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> wiſhes, he wiſhed the ſight of three things in this World, and this was the chiefeſt of all; he did deſire <hi>to ſee</hi> Rome <hi>in its glory;</hi> Paul <hi>in the Pulpit, and Chriſt in the fleſh.</hi> And Brethren, the ſight and enjoyment of the Preſence of Chriſt in our Nature will be one of the happy ſights in Heaven, it will be a great part of the glory and happineſs of the Saints in Heaven to ſee Jeſus Chriſt, therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Father, I will that thoſe whom thou haſt given mee, may be with me, where I am, that they may behold my glory,</hi> John 17.24. So the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.2. <hi>When he ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> I tell you it is a deſirable thing to ſee Jeſus Chriſt in the Fleſh, and yet this I may ſay, that it is poſſible for men and women to ſee Chriſt in the fleſh, and yet be never the better for it. You know when Jeſus Chriſt was in the World, the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſaw him, and were near unto him, and yet were never the better for him; We read that when Chriſt was ſent by <hi>Pilate</hi> to <hi>Herod, Herod</hi> rejoyced to ſee him, but he was never the better for that ſight; for he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:40096:25"/> derided him, and mocked him, and ſent him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. You know <hi>Judas</hi> had a full Sight of Chriſt, he lived many years in the family with Chriſt, yet <hi>Judas</hi> was never the better for ſeeing and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bodily preſence of Chriſt. The Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, the wicked of the World, at the laſt day ſhall ſee Chriſt in his higheſt glory, but ſhall be never a whit the better. I remember 'tis ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.30. <hi>That all the Tribes of the Earth ſhall ſee him, and mourn;</hi> they ſhall behold him in his glory, and yet mourn. What ſhall we ſay then? You ſee we may behold Jeſus Chriſt in the Fleſh, and yet be never the better, but now to enjoy the preſence of the Spirit here in this life, a Soul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enjoy that, but he ſhall be the better for it. It is true indeed, in Heaven, there the Saints ſhall enjoy the preſence of Chriſt, and the fulneſs of the Spirit too, but here in this life for the Saints to enjoy the preſence of the Spirit, it is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for them, more profitable, more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious for them, than to enjoy the very perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal preſence of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now to give you a few Reaſons for it, to ſhew you wherein it is more profitable, more expedient to have the preſence of the Spirit, than to enjoy the very bodily preſence of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In regard that <hi>By enjoying the preſence of the Spirit they may have more reall Comfort than they could have by the enjoyment of the perſonal preſence of Chriſt.</hi> You ſhall ſee the Diſciples them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves all the time that they did enjoy the perſonal preſence of Chriſt in the World, they had not that meaſure of joy and rejoycing as they had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, they had not that meaſure of Comfort
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:40096:25"/> and Conſolation all the time that Chriſt lived in the Earth, and converſed with them, as they had after Chriſt was taken away from them; then they had more real joy. Alas! before they were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to griefs and troubles at every turn, when they came into danger then they were affrighted and troubled, when they were in a ſtorm at Sea, and were ready to ſink they cryed out and were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid; but now after Chriſt was gone and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the Spirit fell down upon them, you ſhall ſee then how full of joy and comfort and conſolation they were, and ſo Chriſt tells them before in this very Chapter, <hi>verſe</hi> 21. <hi>A Woman when ſhe is in travel hath ſorrow, becauſe her Hour is come, but aſſoon as ſhe is delivered ſhe rejoyceth:</hi> So it ſhall be with you, ſaith Chriſt; whileſt I am with you, you cannot have ſuch joy, and when you hear of my departure, ſorrow filleth your hearts, but when I am taken from you, and the Comforter is come, then you ſhall rejoyce; and therefore obſerve, when Chriſt ſpeaks of ſending the Spirit inſtead of his own bodily preſence, he expreſſeth it under the Notion of the Comforter, <hi>When the Comforter ſhall come:</hi> O then they ſhall have ſuch comforts, and conſolation, and joy, that they never had before; and ſo, <hi>John</hi> 14.16. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter;</hi> and ſo, <hi>verſe</hi> 26. <hi>But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my Name—.</hi> So <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.26. <hi>But when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter is come, whom I will ſend unto you from the Father—.</hi> Still when Chriſt ſpeaks of ſending the Spirit, he ſpeaks of ſending him under the Notion of a Comforter, which is to imply, that they ſhall
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40096:26"/> have more true matter of Comfort, of joy and rejoycing, than ever they had before by his bodily preſence, and therefore ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, As our Tribulations abound for Chriſt, ſo our Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations alſo do ſuper-abound,</hi> and ſaith the Apoſtle again, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>We glory in Tribulations,</hi> which is an high expreſſion. Before, upon every occaſion, they were afraid when they came into danger, but now, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We glory in Tribulations,</hi> we joy and rejoyce in the higheſt degree of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing. The Apoſtles, whileſt Chriſt lived, never had that fulneſs of Spiritual joy and conſolation as they had after Chriſt was gone, and the Spirit was ſent down from Heaven, and therefore that is one Reſpect why it is better to enjoy the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Spirit than the perſonal Preſence of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>By having the Spirit, the Comforter, ſent down to them, thereby they come to have more Boldneſs and ſpiritual Courage than they had before.</hi> Alas! before how ready were they to be affrighted and ſcared at every turn, whileſt they had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt; you ſee how they were affrighted when Chriſt was apprehended, they all forſook him and fled; and when <hi>Peter</hi> would needs peep into the Judgment Hall, you ſee how he was diſmayed and afraid when a Maid ſpoke to him, and told him <hi>Thou art one of his Companions,</hi> and he denyed it and ſwore he never knew him, ſo timorous and fearful he was; but afterwards, he grew bold and couragious when the Spirit did deſcend upon him; ſee the Courage of <hi>Peter</hi> and the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts,</hi> 4. when they came before the Judgment Seat, <hi>Verſe.</hi> 8. <hi>And when they had
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40096:26"/> ſet them in the midſt, they asked, By what power, or by what Name have you done this? then</hi> Peter <hi>filled with the Holy Ghoſt, ſaid unto them,</hi> Verſe 10. <hi>Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Iſrael, that by the Name of Jeſus Chriſt of Nazareth whom ye crucified, whom God raiſed from the dead, even by him doth this man ſtand here before you whole.</hi> This was a Spirit of Boldneſs. And <hi>Verſe</hi> 13. <hi>When they ſaw the Boldneſs of Peter and John</hi> — Now they had more Spiritual Boldneſs, Courage and Audacity than they had before, now the Spirit was poured down upon them. And <hi>Verſe</hi> 19. when they commanded them to ſpeak no more in the Name of Jeſus, <hi>Then Peter and John ſaid unto them, Whether it be right in the ſight of God to hearken unto you rather than unto God, judge ye: for we cannot but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard.</hi> Thus by the plentiful effuſion of the Spirit they grew more ſpiritually bold.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When they were deprived of Chriſts perſonal preſence, then being indued with the Spirit, <hi>They had more Chriſtian ſtrength and power given to them than they had before, to act and do for Chriſt;</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then they were ſaid to be endued with power from on high, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49. When Chriſt was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to aſcend up to Heaven he told them they ſhould be endued with <hi>Power from on high;</hi> Ay, the Spirit is a Spirit of power, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>God hath given to us not the Spirit of Fear, but of power, of love, and of a ſound mind;</hi> The Spirit of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. When the Spirit falls down upon a perſon 'tis a Spirit of Power, that they ſhall be able to do and ſuffer for the Name of Chriſt very great things: they are now endued with power from
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40096:27"/> above. Now Chriſt was gone and the Spirit come, therefore you ſee how they did act. They went up and down, and could preach every day from place to place, they travelled up and down to preach the Goſpel; and you ſhall ſee what great works they did, as great works as Chriſt himſelf did do when he was upon Earth, they raiſed up <hi>Tabitha</hi> from the dead, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. And it is ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. that the very <hi>ſhadow</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> paſſing by cured them that were ſick. We do not read of ſuch miracles when Chriſt was upon Earth; great power they had then; ſee what power <hi>Paul</hi> had to go through Sufferings, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23, 24, 25. How he ſuffered abundantly, and ſaith he, <hi>I know that tribulations and ſufferings abide for me in every place, but none of theſe things move me,</hi> he was indued with power from on high: now ſaith he, <hi>I am able to do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> Philip. 4.13.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By having the Preſence of the Spirit with them after they were deprived of the bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt, <hi>Then they had a more powerful gift and Spirit of prayer.</hi> Never ſuch a Spirit of Prayer all the time that Chriſt lived with them, then the Spirit of Prayer was poured down upon them, as it was propheſied, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>I will pour out upon the houſe of Judah the Spirit of Grace and Supplication;</hi> now they were able to pray, to pour out their Souls abundantly to God in prayer: before, all the time that Chriſt was amongſt them, they were poor ſhallow weak Creatures, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pray, and therefore they came to Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.2. <hi>Lord teach us to pray as John taught his Diſciples,</hi> they had not the Spirit of prayer then,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:40096:27"/> in compariſon with what they had afterwards, therefore Chriſt was fain to dictate words to them as you do to your little Children, to ſay word after word after you; thus they came to Chriſt, Lord teach us to pray: but afterward when Chriſt was aſcended and left them, and the Spirit poured out upon them, then they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pour out their prayers upon every occaſion; although 'tis true, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>We know not how to pray as we ought,</hi> that is, we our ſelves left to our ſelves, <hi>but the Spirit within us helps our infirmities with ſighs and groans that cannot be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</hi> The Apoſtles prayed ſo ſtrongly that they ſhook the very room where they were praying, <hi>Acts</hi> 4, 23. <hi>And being let go they went to their own Company, and reported all that the Chief Prieſts and Elders ſaid unto them, and when they heard that, they lift their voice to God with one accord,</hi> and mark <hi>Verſe</hi> 31. <hi>And when they had prayed, the place was ſhaken where they were aſſembled together.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Acts</hi> 16. 'tis ſaid, <hi>They prayed at Midnight and praiſed God, and the very foundation of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was ſhaken by their very Prayers;</hi> There was a mighty powerfull Spirit of Prayer that fell down upon them when Chriſt was gone from them: therefore in that reſpect alſo the preſence of the Spirit is more expedient for them than to enjoy the bodily preſence of Chriſt. And let me add one thing more.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It was more expedient for them to have the preſence of the Spirit, than to have the bodily preſence of Chriſt, becauſe by <hi>Enjoying the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Comforter, hereby they had more aſſiſtance and more powerfull ſucceſs in their work and labour
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40096:28"/> in their Miniſtry, than ever they had before all the time they had the preſence of Chriſt;</hi> I ſay, Their Miniſtry was more powerful and effectual than ever it was before. 'Tis true, they went up and down and preached ſome particular times, but we do not read of any great matter was done, that many were converted by their Miniſtry all the time they lived with Chriſt; but now when Chriſt was gone, and the Spirit fell down upon them, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately you ſhall ſee, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. When <hi>Peter</hi> preached one Sermon, more were converted at that Sermon, than there was by all the Apoſtles preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we read of, all the time they lived with Chriſt upon Earth, there were <hi>Three thouſand</hi> brought in at one Sermon. And afterwards, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.21. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>There were many thouſand Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers brought in by the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Spirit did aſſiſt them;</hi> There was a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty effuſion of the Spirit, and a great ſucceſs upon their Labours and Endeavours. And ſo Chriſt here in the Text, to comfort his Diſciples about his departure, ſaith he, <hi>Nevertheleſs, I tell you the Truth, it is expedient for you that I go away.</hi> What then? Saith he, <hi>I will ſend the Comforter,</hi> and you ſhall find marvellous ſucceſs by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Spirit in your Miniſtry; When he is come, <hi>He ſhall convince the World of Sin, of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and of Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By enjoying the preſence of the Spirit with them, they had mighty ſucceſs in their Miniſtry, in their Labours and Endeavours in the Work that Chriſt had called them to. Therefore, I ſay in theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, it was more expedient for them to have the preſence of the Spirit, than Chriſt's Bodily
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40096:28"/> preſence amongſt them. And thus now I have finiſhed this Point, as to the Explication, Proof and clearing of it. Now briefly to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by way of Application, and ſo to wind up all in three or four words.</p>
                  <p>Application 1. <hi>Then hence we are to be admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and warned to take heed, That our Hearts and Affections be not inordinately ſet upon any Creature-Comfort, though never ſo near and dear unto us:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they muſt be taken away from us, or we from them. If we had the Bodily preſence of Chriſt amongſt us, we are not to ſet our hearts inordinately upon him, meerly for his Bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſo as to have our Hearts, as it were, rent or torn aſunder for the want of his bodily preſence: So whatever Creature-Comfort we enjoy in this World, take heed that our Hearts and Affections be not inordinately ſet upon them, becauſe there will come a time when we muſt part, they muſt go from us, or we muſt go from them; as Chriſt told his Diſciples here, it is expedient for you that I go away: and this was that that did fill their hearts ſo with Sorrow, becauſe they were ſo inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately ſet upon his bodily preſence. There are no Creature-Comforts that we can enjoy in this World but we muſt be taken from them, therefore it ſhould be our Wiſdom to have our hearts and affections ſet looſe from them: becauſe the cloſer we are glued to any Creature-Comfort, the greater rending and tearing there will be when we come to be deprived of it. Truth is, our hearts and affections are apt to cleave too cloſe to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-comforts, as outward Relations, Husbands or Wives, Parents or Children, our hearts are apt to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40096:29"/> be glued too cloſe to them, to be inordinately ſet upon them; and therefore hence it comes to paſſe that it is ſo grievous to us to part with them, and that we are ſo inordinate in our ſorrow and grief, when the Lord ſaith, it is expedient for you that I take this or that Comfort from you: and therefore we ſhould do well to follow the Apoſtles Counſel and Admonition which he gives us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.29, 30, 31. <hi>To uſe the World, as if we uſed it not, to enjoy as if we enjoyed not, to poſſeſſe as if we poſſeſſed not: for the faſhion of this World paſſeth away.</hi> It paſſeth away from us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us take heed that our hearts and affections be not inordinately ſet upon any creature-comfort. Brethren, if we ſet our hearts upon any thing, let us ſet them upon thoſe things that ſhall never go away from us, and look after theſe things that ſhall abide with us, as to look after Union with Chriſt by faith, which ſhall never go away from us. To look after the pardon of ſin, and peace with God, reconciliation to God through the blood of Chriſt, which ſhall never go away from us, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall we go from them; therefore now let it be our care and buſineſs to chuſe the better part that ſhall never be taken away from us, chuſe <hi>Maries</hi> part, endeavour after the Communications of the Spirit, the Comforter, the Holy Ghoſt which ſhall abide with you for ever; but I ſay take heed that your hearts and affections be not inordinately ſet upon any creature-comfort, for then your ſorrow and grief will be the greater upon your parting with them, and it is expedient for you to part, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you from them or they from you, and you know not how ſoon. That is the firſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:40096:29"/>2. Then, <hi>Hence we may ſee our great folly, in mourning and grieving immoderately for the parting from, or loſing and being deprived of, any Creature-Comfort, or Outward-Enjoyment.</hi> Here is our folly; Becauſe, poſſibly we mourn and grieve for that which is moſt expedient for us: And, Is not that folly? Though we do not know ſo much, yet the parting with this or that Relation, with this or that Child, or with all our Children, with this Husband, or that Wife, it may be moſt expedient for us. I ſay therefore, Take heed of grieving immoderately, or inordinately for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be our great folly; it may be more expedient for us that they go away, than that they ſtay with us. And truly now it may be we grieve inordinately for the loſs of our Children, or ſuch a Child; We do not know what they might have proved if the Lord had lengthened out their lives to us, they might have proved the greateſt vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ever we met with in the World, though now it may be we cannot think ſo. We do not know how expedient it is; it may be more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for us that they go away; Therefore mourn not inordinately, but ſubmit to the holy Will of God, that knows what is more expedient for us, than we do our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>And ſo for our Eſtates; the Lord takes away our Eſtates from us, our Livelihood in the World, and brings us into a poor and low Eſtate and Condition; Well, do not mourn inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately for the loſs of it; for it may be the more expedient for you to be deprived of your Eſtates, than to have them continued unto you; poſſibly you would have grown more carnal,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40096:30"/> more ſinfull, more profane, inſolent, vain, ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, more laſcivious, wanton and looſe; and ſo you might have run upon your own ruine and deſtruction if the Lord had left you to enjoy what you would have. Saith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Pro. 1.32. <hi>The proſperity of the wicked ſhall deſtroy him.</hi> The Lord doth ſometimes leave ſome to a proſperous eſtate, and it may be a means of their utter undoing. Therefore it may be more expedient for you that they go away; therefore let us not be inordinate in our grief and ſorrow for the loſs of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Comfort.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then, <hi>Hereby we may ſee the fooliſhneſs and vanity of theſe apprehenſions that do ſometimes come into our mindes.</hi> O we are ready to think ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, if we had lived when Chriſt was here in the fleſh, when Chriſt's bodily preſence was in the world, or if we could now ſee and enjoy the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily preſence of Chriſt; O, we ſhould go to him upon all occaſions; O then we could go and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, and reverence him, and honour him, and adore him, and admire him. I tell you theſe are vain fancies and imaginations, for the injoyment of the preſence of the Spirit is more advantagious to us than the enjoyment of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily preſence of Chriſt could be, and if Chriſt were now in the world in our dayes, as he was before, it may be we could not tell how we might come to ſpeak to him, and ſee him, he might be at one end of the world, and we at the other; but now we have this advantage, we may go to Chriſt in any part of the World, and enjoy Communion with Chriſt, and ſpeak to Chriſt in Prayer in any place, and we may worſhip, reverence, honour and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40096:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> love Jeſus Chriſt, now he is in Heaven and Glory. It is ſaid of the Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.51, 52. <hi>They returned to Jeruſalem with great joy, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually in the Temple, praiſing and bleſſing God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I tell you we may worſhip, and reverence and honour Jeſus Chriſt, now he is in Heaven, as much as we could have done if he were bodily preſent with us. It is therefore a vain imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to think, O if Chriſt were now preſent, what worſhip we would now give him, how we would adore him, and acquaint him with our Neceſſities at every turn. You may have as much acceſs to him now, as if he were in the World, and you may have more of the Spirit given to you now than you ſhould have then. And let me add this by the way, not to let your mindes go too much out about the perſonal preſence of Chriſt here on earth; I do not ſpeak to condemn that opinion <hi>That Chriſt ſhall perſonally reign upon Earth a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years,</hi> which is the opinion of many godly and learned Men, and I would not ſpeak contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorily to it, though for my own part I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Chriſt ſhall have a glorious Church upon Earth, and Reign upon Earth a thouſand Years too; Yet I muſt needs ſay, I do not apprehend as to his Bodily preſence. 'Tis true, indeed, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt ſhall come from Heaven at the day of Judgement, and appear perſonally in the Clouds; and if you obſerve it, you ſhall find when the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, in Scripture, ſpeaks about the appearing of Chriſt, you ſhall find he ſpeaks of that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhall be at the Day of Judgment: As, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.14. Saith the Apoſtle there, <hi>I charge you that you keep this Commandment without ſpot,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40096:31"/> untill the appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now what appearing is this? or when ſhall Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? look 2 <hi>Epiſtle</hi> 4.1. <hi>I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> When he ſhall come to Judgment, then he ſhall appear perſonally.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>But you will ſay,</hi> May he not appear for all that before in this World? and may he not come in his own perſon and live in the World before that?</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="answer">
                     <head>Anſwer.</head>
                     <p>Truly, Brethren, I have no warrant for that, but rather to the contrary; for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.28. ſpeaking of Chriſts coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>To them that look for him ſhall he appear the ſecond time</hi> — So that his appearing to judge the World ſhall be his ſecond appearing, to you that look for him ſhall he appear the ſecond time. Now, when he was incarnate in the fleſh, then he appeared the firſt time, but he ſhall appear the ſecond time, that is, when he comes to judg the World: therefore, I ſay, I have no warrant for Chriſts being perſonally on Earth before the day of Judgment; only 'tis true, there ſhal be a glorious appearance of the power of the Spirit, &amp; there ſhall be a glorious Church upon Earth a thouſand years, that I do believe; but for the perſonal appearance of Chriſt and his living perſonally in the World, I confeſs I have not ſuch grounds for that. But I
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40096:31"/> would not trouble your heads about theſe things, neither would I have you trouble your Fancies much about them, but look after the enjoyment of the ſpiritual preſence of Chriſt, that will be more advantagious and expedient for you than the very perſonal preſence of Chriſt. That is the third word of Application. I have but one word more and that is this.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. From hence now we may have a ſtrong An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote and Cordial againſt all our ſorrows, griefs and troubles in parting with any creature-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, though it be our neareſt and deareſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in this World. Know this, for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſupport under all, that it is moſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for you; this is the very cordial and ſupport and antidote, that Jeſus Chriſt himſelf preſcribed to his own Diſciples againſt their immoderate ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; <hi>becauſe I have ſaid theſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſorrow hath filled your hearts,</hi> in the Verſe before the Text, and now he comes to give them a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial and andidote againſt it in the Text, <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I tell you the Truth, it is expedient for you that I go away,</hi> Not for me only: It was expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent indeed for Chriſt himſelf to go away, that he might be advanced at the right hand of God, that he might be indued with the Spirit, and have all fulneſs of gifts to give out, it was expedient for him, <hi>but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I tell you the truth, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for you,</hi> and this he gives them as a cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and antidote againſt their ſorrow, <hi>it is expedient for you that I go away;</hi> but they could not tell how to believe it, that it ſhould be expedient for them that he ſhould go away, therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Nevertheleſs, I tell you the truth; it is expedient for
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40096:32"/> you that I go away.</hi> Truly, Brethren, this is the very Cordial that Chriſt himſelf gave againſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate ſorrow and grief of mind in parting with any creature-comfort in this World: remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, 'tis expedient for you, if the Lord call us to part with any thing that is near and dear to us, near and dear Yoke-Fellows, Husband or Wife, or an only Son, well, here is the Cordial and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote that Chriſt gave, know, ſaith he, That it is expedient for you that this near Comfort go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from you, it is for your advantage, profit, and benefit.</p>
                     <p>Brethren, I pray let me ask you this Queſtion, Do you think that any creature comfort that you enjoy in this World can be nearer and dearer to you than the perſonal preſence of Chriſt was to the Diſciples? Yet ſaith Chriſt, <hi>It is expedient for you that I go away;</hi> truly ſo I may ſay as to every Comfort that God takes from us, It is expedient for us that this comfort be taken from us. It may be you cannot ſee it now, but you may ſee it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, it is that which your heavenly Father knows to be expedient for you, and he is wiſer than we. This may be a Cordial and Antidote both for the time paſt, and for the time preſent and to come: the time paſt, when we call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, O the comfort that ſometimes we had, the comfortable enjoyment of ſuch a Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſuch a Husband, or ſuch a Wife, or ſuch a Child, our hearts are ready to bleed afreſh at the remembrance of it. Now here is a Cordial and Antidote that Chriſt himſelf preſcribes, I tell you the truth, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>It is expedient for you.</hi> O I cannot tell how to think it can be expedient for
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40096:32"/> me to loſe ſuch a Husband, ſuch a Wife, ſuch a Child; yea, ſaith Chriſt, I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that ſuch a comfort be taken away from you. So for the time preſent, if God take away a near Relation, or Wife, or ſuch a Child, remember that Chriſt hath ſaid, it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for you that this Child ſhould go, that this Comfort, that this Relation ſhould go away from you.</p>
                     <p>And Brethren, if we do believe that it is expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for us, why then ſhould we be exceſſive in our grief and ſorrow? I pray tell me, if a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician come unto you, and by reaſon of your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper preſcribe you ſome bitter Pill, or bitter Potion to take, or a ſtrong vomit, or he preſcribe a great deal of blood to be taken from you, theſe things are ſomewhat hard, but he tells you it is expedient for you, and you will yield to it, you will take the Vomit or Purge though never ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to you, you will take the Pill though never ſo bitter to you, and if he will draw ſo much blood from you, let him take it. So the Lord is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deal as a wiſe Phyſician, he preſcribes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a bitter Pill for us to ſwallow down, O to loſe ſuch a Yoke-Fellow, or ſuch a Child, this is a ſtrong vomit, a bitter purge, this is like the drawing of a mans blood from his heart: but our heavenly Father knows what is moſt expedient for us, <hi>I tell you the Truth,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>it is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for you that I go away;</hi> it is expedient for you that I take ſo much blood from you, that I put you upon the ſwallowing of this bitter pill. And remember, and lay up this Antidote againſt a time of need, we know not how ſuddenly any of us
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40096:33"/> here before the Lord may be called to part with our neareſt and deareſt Comforts, we know not how the Lord may deal with us: well, remember this Antidote, and lay it up for the time to come, remember and ſay, Well, it is expedient for me, that this and that Comfort be taken away from me; and you have heard the Reaſons. O remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber theſe words of our Lord Jeſus, which he ſpake to his Diſciples to comfort them againſt their griefs and ſorrow for being deprived of the greateſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort they had in this World. <hi>Nevertheleſs, I tell you the Truth; it is expedient for you that I go away.</hi>

               <p>IN this Chapter (as you have heard) our Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth fore-warn and fore-arm his Diſciples againſt Perſecution and Sufferings, which they were like to meet withal; and this he ſpeaks of in the firſt four <hi>Verſes;</hi> and then he doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to comfort their hearts againſt that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that had poſſeſſed them for his going away from them: Saith he, <hi>Now I go my way to him that ſent me: and becauſe I have ſaid theſe things unto you, ſorrow hath filled your hearts.</hi> Chriſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to comfort their hearts againſt their great ſorrow; and this in the general he propoſeth for their Comfort; Namely, ſaith he, <hi>'Tis expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for you that I go away:</hi> 'Tis not only expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for me, but it is expedient for you that I go away: But they could hardly think ſo: And then
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40096:34"/> he gives them this Reaſon, ſaith he, <hi>If I go not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the Comforter will not come; but if I depart, I will ſend him unto you.</hi> But then they might be ready to ſay, Lord! Suppoſe the Comforter do come, will that make recompence for our loſs of thy preſence? What if the Comforter do come? what if we have the preſence of thy Spirit? yet thy preſence might ſeem to be more comfortable to us. Now Chriſt lays in further for that, ſaith he, If the Comforter come, that will be ſtill better for you than my bodily preſence is; for if he come, he will be with you to aſſiſt you in your Miniſtry: He will accompany the Miniſtration of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in your mouth; he will make your Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be ſuccesful, and effectual, for convincing and converting. Thus now Chriſt doth lay in againſt their ſorrow, that they might have upon his departure from them, that though he went from them, yet they ſhould have that from the promiſe that ſhould countervail all that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and joy that they had by his bodily preſence; And this ſeems to be the very ſcope and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe words. <hi>When he is come,</hi> ſaith he, He will ſo work with your Miniſtry, that it ſhall <hi>Reprove</hi> or <hi>Convince the World of Sin, of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and of Judgement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before I come to the Point, becauſe the words ſeem to have ſome difficulty in them, and becauſe there ſeems to be ſome variety in the Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, I ſhall briefly give you a hint of what I apprehend to be the moſt proper meaning of theſe words. As now,
<list>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:40096:34"/>
                     <item>1. What doth he mean by <hi>Reproving? He ſhall reprove the World,</hi> —</item>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. The word here tranſlated <hi>Reprove,</hi> hath a three-fold acceptation in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Sometimes it ſignifies to Reprove,</hi> as here 'tis tranſlated: And ſo I remember, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.13. <hi>This Witneſs is true: Wherefore rebuke them ſharply,</hi> or reprove them ſharply: 'Tis the ſame Word. So here 'tis tranſlated in the Text. Though I think that is not the proper ſignification or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment of it in this place. For, obſerve it, It is not ſo proper to ſay, That the Spirit, when he comes, ſhall <hi>Reprove</hi> the World of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> he may <hi>reprove</hi> them of <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>rebuke</hi> them for <hi>Sin,</hi> but not of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> nor for <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> nor of <hi>Judgement.</hi> That is one ſignification of the word, to Reprove or Rebuke.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Sometimes <hi>the word ſignifies to make manifeſt, or to make evident, to make apparent,</hi> ſo you ſhall find it, John 3.20, 21. <hi>Every one that doth evil, hateth the Light, Neither cometh to the Light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved</hi> (or made manifeſt) and it is expounded in the next verſe, <hi>made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt; But he that doth Truth cometh to the Light, that his deeds may be [made manifeſt] that they are wrought in God;</hi> it is the ſame Word here in the Text. But this cannot be the meaning of this Word in the Text, that he ſhall make manifeſt Sin,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40096:35"/> and make manifeſt Righteouſneſs, and make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Judgment: though there be a Truth in that, yet this cannot be the full intendment of this word in this place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is another ſignification of it, and that is to <hi>convince,</hi> and ſo 'tis in the Margin, <hi>He ſhall convince the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgment;</hi> and ſo I remember it is, <hi>John</hi> 8.46. ſaith Chriſt there, <hi>Which of you doth convince me of Sin?</hi> It is the ſame Word: he doth not ſay, which of you charges me with Sin? for they did charge him with Sin enough, and they did reprove and rebuke him for Sin, they ſaid, he was a <hi>Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer;</hi> therefore that cannot be the meaning of the Word to charge or reprove him of Sin; but, <hi>which of you can convince me of Sin?</hi> to make it apparent without gain-ſaying, that I am guilty of any Sin. And ſo I think that place, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.9. <hi>holding faſt the faithful Word, as he hath been taught, that he may be able by ſound Doctrine, both to exhort, and to convince the Gain-ſayers.</hi> And ſo I ſhall take it in this ſenſe all along; when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter is come he ſhall aſſiſt you in your Miniſtry, ſo as he ſhall thereby convince the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgment.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>What doth he mean by the World?</hi> Not the whole Univerſe, the Fabrick of Heaven and Earth, no, that cannot be the meaning of it: but it is to be underſtood of Men, the World of Men, of ſinful Men, Men that are guilty of Sin; and more particularly, by the World we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the unbelieving World, a company of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: Now unbelievers they may ſome of them be elected and are elected, and ſhall be brought to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40096:35"/> believe in Chriſt in time, through the Goſpel; and ſome of them are not elected, and ſhall never be brought to believe in Chriſt. Now which of theſe doth Chriſt here mean? when he ſpeaks of the World, whether he means only thoſe Unbelievers that are elected, and ſhall be brought on to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (ſo ſome think): or whether he means the Unbelievers of the World that were never elected, and ſhall never be brought to believe in Chriſt (ſo others.) Truly I ſee nothing to the contrary but we may include both, namely, Unbelievers that are not elected, the Holy Ghoſt ſhall come and convince them of Sin, though they ſhall go no further, there may be convictions where no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion follows; and this is the work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to convince of Sin, and he ſhall alſo convince Unbelievers that are elected, convince them effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſo as they ſhall be brought on to converſion, and I think eſpecially and chiefly our Saviour here meaneth thoſe Unbelievers in the World that are elected, though I would not exclude the other, but thoſe eſpecially that are elected, and ſhall be brought on through conviction and converſion to ſalvation; for Chriſt doth ſpeak theſe Words by way of Comfort to the Diſciples, that the Spirit ſhall come and aſſiſt them in their Miniſtry; it is ſome comfort indeed if any be convinced, but that is not ſo much comfort as to be convinced and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually wrought upon to ſalvation, and this comfort Chriſt doth hold forth as an Antidote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſadneſs and ſorrow, upon his going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. And then he ſhall convince the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgment.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not now come to ſpeak particularly, to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40096:36"/> open theſe in particular to you, but only thus much in ſhort to ſhew you how the World was convinced by the Apoſtles Miniſtry, immediately after Chriſts Aſcenſion into Heaven, the World was then convinced; the World of the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Jews was convinced of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgment. Look but into that Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. which was preached upon the occaſion of the falling down of the Holy Ghoſt, the coming of the Comforter, which Chriſt promiſeth here; you ſhall ſee there how the Jews were convinced, both of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgment, by the coming of the Holy Ghoſt upon them in that very Sermon, <hi>verſe</hi> 23. There he convinces them of Sin, <hi>In murdering and crucifying the Lord of Glory;</hi> they were ſo far from believing on Chriſt as their Saviour, that they did murder him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, ſaith the Apoſtle in another place, <hi>If ſo be they had known,</hi> and ſo believed in Chriſt, <hi>they would not have crucifyed the Lord of Glory;</hi> but ſaith he, <hi>Him being delivered by the determinate Counſel of God, ye have taken and by wicked hands have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed and ſlain.</hi> He tells them plainly that they were guilty of murdering the Son of God, and they were ſo convinced at this Word, that they did not gainſay it, but were pricked in their hearts; thus they were convinced of Sin, that they did not believe in Chriſt, but inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving they murdered him: and then they were convinced alſo of Righteouſneſs, namely, of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, that Chriſt was a Righteous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom they crucifyed and ſlew, <hi>verſe</hi> 22. <hi>Ye Men of Iſrael, hear theſe words, Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth, a Man approved of God, by Signs and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40096:36"/> Wonders and Miracles, which God did by him in the midſt of you, as your ſelves know;</hi> the Apoſtle here holds forth that he was a Righteous Perſon, and they crucifyed a Righteous Perſon, and what had they to ſay againſt this? No, they were ſilent, they laid their hands upon their mouth, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards their hands come upon their heart, and they were pricked at the heart, and now they were convinced of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; and alſo of Judgment, that now God had given all power to execute Judgment, into the hand of Chriſt, unto this Son of man whom they crucified, and ſlew. So <hi>verſe</hi> 24. <hi>Whom God hath raiſed up, having looſed the pains of death, becauſe it was not poſſible that he ſhould be holden of it; he overcame Death, and overcame the Devil that had the power of Death;</hi> and at <hi>Verſe</hi> 31. he ſeeing this before, ſpake of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, that his Soul was not left in Hell, <hi>This Jeſus hath God raiſed up, whereof we all are witneſſes;</hi> Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promiſe of the Holy Ghoſt — having received all Power, and Authority, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and Government, over all Principalities and Powers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By this means he convinced them of Judgment; <hi>for the Prince of this World is judged,</hi> Chriſt is exalted at the Right hand of God, and they had nothing to ſay againſt what the Apoſtle ſpake, but their hearts were pricked, and now, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the intendment and ſcope of Chriſt in theſe Words, is to comfort the Hearts of his Diſciples againſt his going away, and now ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I will ſend the Comforter unto you:</hi> and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40096:37"/> when he is come he ſhall ſo aſſiſt you in your Miniſtry, that you ſhall be able to <hi>Convince the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgment;</hi> your Miniſtry ſhall be made effectual, operative, and ſaving; and this he delivereth as an Antidote againſt their ſorrow for his going away from them. And here is the Point that I ſhall briefly take up to ſpeak to at this preſent, if the Lord pleaſe.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Doct.</hi> That it is a matter of unſpeakable Joy and Conſolation unto the faithful Servants of Chriſt, that their Miniſtry is made effectual through the power of the Spirit of Chriſt for the ſaving of poor Souls.</q>
               <p>Chriſt gives them this very thing as an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, as a Comfort and Cordial againſt their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row which their hearts are filled with for his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away from them, ſaith he, the Comforter ſhall come to you, and be with your Miniſtry, and make your Miniſtry effectual and powerful and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to the Souls of many perſons in the World, and this he gives as an Antidote againſt their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. And truly I might have ſaid it is a matter of the greateſt. Comfort that any thing in the World can afford to the faithful Servants of Chriſt that their Miniſtry is made effectual to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the Salvation of Souls; he ſpeaks of it you ſee, as a Comfort ſuitable to their ſorrow, that is able to weigh down their ſorrow, that though they were ſo filled with ſorrow at Chriſts depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from them, yet ſaith Chriſt, you ſhall have that, that is as comfortable to you as my bodily
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40096:37"/> preſence can be, you ſhall have the co-working of the Spirit with you in your Miniſtry to make it effectual for the furtherance of the ſalvation of poor Souls.</p>
               <p>For the opening of this Point I ſhall ſpeak to theſe four things that are implyed and wrapt up in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Miniſtry of the Goſpel is the Means of the converſion and ſalvation of Souls. This is implyed here, They ſhall go out to preach, and this ſhould be for their Comfort, that they ſhould be inſtrumental for the converſion and ſalvation of Souls.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is through the power of the Spirit, that the Miniſtry of the Goſpel comes to be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al for the converſion and ſalvation of Souls. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I will ſend the Comforter to you, the Holy Ghoſt, and he ſhall convince the World of Sin,</hi> he ſhall make the Word that you preach efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to further the ſalvation of Souls.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That as the Miniſtry of the Goſpel alone of it ſelf cannot, ſo neither will the Holy Ghoſt work efficaciouſly and ſavingly to the converſion and ſalvation of Souls without the Miniſtry of the Goſpel. Chriſt doth not ſay the Spirit alone ſhall work effectually, and convertingly, and ſavingly, no, but with your Miniſtry. It was therefore ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for their Comfort, the Spirit ſhall come along with your Miniſtry, and ſhall work effectually, and convincingly, and ſavingly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is matter of exceeding great and unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Conſolation and Joy to the faithful Servants of Chriſt, that their Miniſtery through the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit is made efficacious and effectual
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40096:38"/> for the convincing and converting and ſaving of any Soul. Briefly to run over theſe things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Miniſtration of the Goſpel is the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Means of the Converſion and Salvation of Souls.</hi> And therefore hence it is that the Goſpel is called ſometimes the Word of Salvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.26. <hi>To you is this Word of Salvation ſent;</hi> the Word of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that is the Goſpel; and ſometimes 'tis called the Goſpel of Salvation, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>The Goſpel of your Salvation,</hi> ſaith he; and ſometimes 'tis called Salvation it ſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great Salvation?</hi> If we neglect the Goſpel we cannot eſcape damnation: The Goſpel is called Salvation, beauſe 'tis the Inſtrument and the means of converſion and ſalvation. And hence it is that people are ſaid to be begotten and born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain unto God by the Goſpel. Saith <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Though you have ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Inſtructors in Chriſt, yet you have not many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; for in Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the Goſpel;</hi> I have begotten you, ſaith he, to be Children of God by the Goſpel. So <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Philemon</hi> concerning <hi>Oneſimus,</hi> at the <hi>10th verſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Receive him, for I have begotten him in my bonds. Paul</hi> was then a priſoner, and <hi>Oneſimus</hi> ran away from his Maſter <hi>Philemon,</hi> and came to <hi>Paul,</hi> and he was an inſtrument to beget him again to God by the Goſpel; ſo ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.1, 2. <hi>The Goſpel by which you are ſaved</hi> — And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> calls it <hi>the Word of Truth, whereby Souls are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to God, Cap.</hi> 1.8. And ſo <hi>Peter</hi> alſo, ſaith, <hi>Ye are born again by the incorruptible ſeed, the Word,</hi> namely, the Word of the Goſpel. So that the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40096:38"/> Holy Ghoſt doth teſtify to us that the Goſpel is the Means of the Converſion and Salvation of Souls.</p>

                  <p>Briefly; for I muſt not inlarge, <hi>The Goſpel is a Means of Converſion and Salvation</hi> (namely) <hi>part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by diſcovering or convincing People where they are out of the way of Salvation;</hi> as in the Text, I <hi>will ſend the Comforter, and he ſhall convince the World of Sin,</hi> of their ſinful Eſtate, and how they are out of the Way of Salvation, and doth diſcover and convince them, and ſhew them the right way; and alſo the Goſpel is a means to open and enlighten the Underſtandings of People, to open their blind Eyes; as Chriſt told <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſent him to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>Go,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have ſent thee to open the Eyes of them that are blind, and to turn them from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Light;</hi> that is, by the Miniſtry of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The Goſpel is a Means to open peoples Eyes, to turn them from Darkneſs to Light, to make them ſee that they are in a ſtate of Darkneſs, to make them ſee that there is a glorious Light held forth in the Goſpel: as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Who hath called you out of Darkneſs into his marvelous Light;</hi> This is that the Goſpel is a Means of, and ſo it brings to a ſtate of Salvation. And again, the Goſpel is a Means to deliver peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the power of the Devil; every one natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is in the power of Satan, he rules and works
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40096:39"/> in all the Children of Unbelief; Now the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is a means to bring Souls from under the power of Satan; and ſo Chriſt told <hi>Paul</hi> in that 26th of <hi>Acts, I have ſent thee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to turn them from Darkneſs to Light, and from the power of Satan to God.</hi> The Goſpel is a Means of that; therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The Weapons of our Warfare are not carnal, but mighty, through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds,</hi> to beat down the Batteries, and Caſtles, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications that Satan builds; it is mighty to pull down the power of Satan, and ſo by that means to bring a Soul into a State of Converſion and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. And alſo the Goſpel is the Means to work faith in the heart, to cauſe a Soul to believe on Chriſt, 'tis a means of that, and ſo by that means the Soul comes to be juſtified, and freed from the guilt of Sin. <hi>Faith,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God, Rom.</hi> 10.17. Faith cometh by hearing the Goſpel preached; God is pleaſed to make uſe of the preaching of the Goſpel to work Faith in the Souls of poor Sinners, and by working Faith in their Souls, drawing them unto Chriſt. Now by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Chriſt they come to have remiſſion of Sins, as Chriſt told <hi>Paul</hi> in that of the <hi>Acts, To turn them from Darkneſs to Light, from the power of Satan to God, that they might receive Forgiveneſs of Sins, and an inheritance among them that are ſanctified,</hi> and all by Faith in Chriſt: So that I ſay, the Goſpel is the means ordained and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God for the Salvation of Souls; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let no body think that the Miniſtry of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is a needleſs thing, as many are ready to think
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40096:40"/> in their minds, that of all the Callings in the World the Miniſtry of the Goſpel may be beſt ſpared. Truly, if ſo be that the Salvation of Souls be not neceſſary, then the Calling of Miniſters to their Office, and their preaching of the Goſpel, may be ſpared, but you ſee Chriſt hath appointed it to be the means of Converſion and Salvation; and therefore, whatever people may think ſecretly in their minds that we may edifie our ſelves by reading a Chapter, and meditating upon it, by reading of good Books, and what need we to trouble o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r ſelves to wait upon the Miniſtry of the Goſpel? Truly know this, <hi>That the Fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is wiſer than the Wiſdom of Man:</hi> God hath pleaſed to ordain and appoint the Miniſtry of the Goſpel to be the means of Converſion and Salvation, and therefore if the Converſion of Souls be neceſſary, then the preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is neceſſary; therefore let us take heed we do not neglect attending upon the Goſpel, and the preaching of the Goſpel as we would be loth to neglect our own Salvation. That is the firſt, That the Goſpel is the Means of working a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and converting Work upon the Souls of Men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond is, <hi>That the Goſpel alone of it ſelf cannot work a ſaving and converting Work upon any Soul;</hi> no, <hi>there muſt be the Operation of the Spirit of Chriſt, that muſt go along with the Gſopel,</hi> or elſe the Goſpel will never be able to work any ſaving converting Work upon any Soul; 'tis true indeed, the Goſpel is the Word of Salvation; Ay, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. <hi>It is the Power of God to Salvation;</hi> Ay, where
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40096:40"/> the power of God goeth along with it, it works Salvation by the power of the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.4. <hi>The Weapons of our Warfare are mighty through God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; not mighty in themſelves. The Weapons of our Warfare, what is that? The Miniſtry of the Goſpel, the Preaching of the Goſpel is mighty, but it is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through God to the pulling down of Strong Holds. Alas! of it ſelf it cannot, the Goſpel of it ſelf is but a weak Letter; but where the Power of the Spirit goes along with it, it is mighty, mighty through God, mighty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and mighty to convert, and mighty to ſave; therefore the Goſpel is compared to a Sword, and it is called the Sword of the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Take to you the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God;</hi> It is a Sword that cannot do good, except it be wielded by the hand of the Spirit of God: It is not now as a natural cauſe to effect any thing; as now our Food is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral cauſe, ſanctified and ordained by God as a natural cauſe of nouriſhment. Phyſick is ordained as a natural Cauſe of health; but 'tis not ſo with the Word, the Miniſtry of the Word is but as a Tool or Inſtrument in a Workmans hand, in a Carpenter or Joyners hand; the Tool of it ſelf cannot work, the Word of it ſelf cannot work, but as it is in the Workmans hand, ſo it works. Truly ſo, the Sword of the Spirit, in the hand of the Spirit, that will work to the convincing and converting, and ſaving of a Soul, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it cannot do it; no, it is but weak in it ſelf; even as a Sword that cannot move or lift up it ſelf: but now in the hand of the Spirit
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40096:41"/> the Spirit, the Goſpel is mighty to open the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to open the heart. We read the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> was opened when ſhe heard <hi>Paul</hi> preach, but it was not <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching, but the Spirits go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along with it, that did open her heart, and ſhe attended to what was ſpoken by <hi>Paul;</hi> and ſo the Spirit with the Word is mighty to draw a Soul to Chriſt, not the Word alone; no, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 5.44, 45. <hi>No man can come unto me, except the Father draw him;</hi> that is, there muſt be the mighty Power of the Spirit of God con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>curring, to work with the Word, to draw and perſwade and convince by the Word, and then it works. And ſo the Spirit with the Word will cauſe a Soul to grow and encreaſe in a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Eſtate. <hi>Paul</hi> may plant, and <hi>Apollos</hi> may water, but it is the Lord muſt give the encreaſe to make the growth. So it is, one may preach, and another may preach, but ſtill there muſt be the concurrance and work of the Spirit, or elſe all our preaching will be but like the watering of a dead plant; but the Spirit of the Lord muſt come and be preſent, and then our preaching, our planting and watering may be bleſſed for thoſe ends for which God hath appointed it: And the reaſon is this, That without the Spirit of God, the Word, though it be ordained of God to be a Means of Converſion and Salvation, yet the Word alone without the Spirit cannot do it, becauſe the Miniſtry of the Word is too weak to make an Impreſſion upon our hard hearts.</p>
                  <p>Take a Seal, and ſet it upon a Rock or Stone, it makes no Impreſſion, Why? Becauſe there is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40096:41"/> no pliableneſs in the Rock or Stone to receive the Impreſſion: Thus it is with our hearts; our hearts are naturally like ſo many Stones; therefore ſee what the Lord promiſes, <hi>To take away the heart of Stone, and to give a heart of Fleſh;</hi> a ſoft heart, the hardneſs of it ſhall be taken away; that when the Word comes as a Seal to make an Impreſſion upon the heart, the Spirit doth change the heart, and makes it pliable to receive the Impreſſion, which othewiſe it could not do. You may as well make an Impreſſion upon a Rock or Stone, as upon any Heart, till the Spirit come and ſoften the heart, and make it pliable to receive the impreſſion of the Word; and therefore hence you may obſerve, That ſometimes, when divers hear the ſame Word preached, there are diverſity of effects in the ſame hearers hearing the ſame Word, ſome are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and others not; ſome believe, and others not. As <hi>Acts</hi> 17. When <hi>Paul</hi> had been preaching to them, <hi>Verſe</hi> 32, 34. <hi>When they heard of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the dead, ſome mocked, and others ſaid, We will hear thee again of this matter: Howbeit certain clave to him, and believed.</hi> Ay, ſome recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Goſpel, and others not; ſome believed, and others not.</p>
                  <p>As I remember, 'tis ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 28.24. <hi>Some believed the things that were ſpoken, and ſome belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not;</hi> And, What is the Reaſon? The Spirit doth work effectually with the Goſpel upon ſome hearts, but not upon others; that is the reaſon that ſome believed, and ſome believed not. And hence it is again, that ſometimes ſome are more hardned by the very word of the Goſpel: So far from being converted and brought into a ſtate of Salvation,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40096:42"/> that they are more hardned and ſet further off, nearer to their damnation. What is the reaſon? Becauſe there wants the preſence of the Spirit, and therefore you ſhall ſee <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9. ſaith the Lord to the Prophet (he was an Evangelical Prophet) <hi>Go,</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>make this peoples heart hard;</hi> go and harden their hearts, that they may hear, and not underſtand, that they may not be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and ſaved; Let their hearts be more hardned, ſaith God, by hearing the Goſpel preached: nay ſometimes, what is the reaſon that the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ableſt Preacher of the Goſpel in the World; that their Miniſtry is ſometimes leſs efficacious than the Miniſtry of them that are far inferiour to them? what is the reaſon? Becauſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Spirit goeth along with the one and not with the other. You ſhall ſee Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the moſt eminent Preacher that ever was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven, <hi>John</hi> 22.36, 37. He preaches there; and though he did Miracles before them, yet they believed not on him; that the ſaying of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet might be fulfilled, <hi>Lord, who hath believed our Report? and to whom hath the Arm of the Lord been revealed;</hi> And therefore they could not believe, becauſe, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith again, <hi>He hath blinded their Eyes, and hardned their hearts</hi> — Theſe things, ſaid <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> when he ſaw his glory and ſpake of him; when he ſaw the glory of Chriſt, when he was moſt Evangelical in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, then he ſpake theſe Words, whereas <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> now, that was far inferiour to Chriſt, having the preſence of the Spirit mightily poured down upon him, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. (where the Holy Ghoſt fell down upon the Apoſtles like ſo many fiery cloven
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40096:42"/> tongues.) <hi>Peter</hi> preached to them, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted three thouſand Souls at one Clap, becauſe of the powerful preſence of the Spirit together with the Word. Therefore, Brethren, ſtill let us not ſatisfy our ſelves with hearing the Goſpel preached, though we had the moſt eminent preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that ever was in the World, though we ſhould have heard Chriſt himſelf, but look for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Spirit, the breathings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, wait upon God for the communicating and giving out of his Spirit, that they may make the Goſpel to be the Miniſtration, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit, for it is the Spirits Work to make the Goſpel effectual and operative for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Salvation of Souls.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In a Word, that, <hi>As the Preaching of the Goſpel of it ſelf cannot convert, or ſave any Soul, So neither will the Holy Ghoſt without the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and preaching of the Goſpel.</hi> You heard before that the Preaching of the Goſpel cannot do it alone; But cannot the Spirit? will not the Spirit do it alone? It can do it alone indeed, But mark I pray, the Spirit will <hi>not ordinarily</hi> convince and convert effectually and ſavingly any Soul without the Miniſtration of the Goſpel: To give you but a Scripture or two for this, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. You ſee there Chriſt himſelf ſpeaks to <hi>Paul;</hi> you know how he met with him as he was going to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> to perſecute the Saints, and Chriſt ſpake immediately to him, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> well, <hi>who art thou, Lord?</hi> ſaith he; <hi>I am Jeſus, whom thou perſecuteſt;</hi> Well, <hi>Verſe</hi> 6. You ſhall ſee, ſaith <hi>Paul, Lord, What wouldeſt thou have me to do?</hi> Mark now,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40096:43"/> Chriſt doth not preach the Goſpel immediately himſelf, but he ſends him to one to preach to him; <hi>Go into</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>and there it ſhall be told thee what thou ſhalt do;</hi> and there Chriſt ſent <hi>Ananias</hi> to preach the Goſpel to him; Chriſt himſelf would not preach the Goſpel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him, nor he would not convert nor ſave his Soul without the Miniſtration of the Goſpel. And look into <hi>Acts</hi> 10. See there concerning <hi>Cornelius,</hi> there was an Angel from Heaven ſent to him, he had been faſting and praying, and that hour there came an Angel of God to him to tell him that God had heard his Prayers, and accepted his Alms, but why may not the Angel preach the Goſpel immediately? No, the Lord would have the Goſpel diſpenſed in an ordinary way of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not by an Angel from Heaven, therefore <hi>Verſe</hi> 5. <hi>And now ſend men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whoſe Surname is Peter, and he ſhall tell thee words whereby thou and thy houſe ſhall be ſaved,</hi> he ſhall preach the Goſpel effectually to you; and you ſhall ſee afterwards, <hi>Verſe</hi> 33. <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately therefore I ſent to thee, and thou haſt done well that thou art come: now therefore are we all here preſent before God to hear thee;</hi> and <hi>Verſe</hi> 44. <hi>Whileſt Peter ſpake theſe Words, the Holy Ghoſt fell on all them which heard the Word.</hi> Why did not the Angel himſelf preach the Goſpel to <hi>Cornelius?</hi> Why was not he an Inſtrument of his Converſion and Salvation? no, the Holy Ghoſt will not work alone without the ordinary concurrence of the Miniſtration of the Goſpel, and therefore look at it as a deluſion of Satan, if ſo be that upon any pretence whatſoever, any ſhall endeavour to take
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40096:43"/> you off from attending upon the Miniſtry of the Goſpel upon pretence of the Spirit, that the Spirit ſhall anoint us and teach us all things —. Well, look upon it as a Deluſion of Satan, if it be to take you off from attending upon the Miniſtery of the Goſpel which is the ordinary way that God hath appointed; and take this for an univerſal Rule, That whatever it be that tends to take any people off from any Ordinance of God, or any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of God, look at it as a deluſion of Satan, let it be under any pretence whatſoever; as now, to take one off from Duties and Ordinances, to wait till the Spirit come immediately to inſpire — look upon it as a Deluſion, becauſe it tends to take you off from the ordinary Inſtitutions that God hath appointed. So, you ſee the Goſpel is the Means of Converſion and Salvation, the Goſpel without the Spirit cannot do it, and the Spirit without the Goſpel will not do it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The fourth thing is this, <hi>That it is a matter of unſpeakable Joy and Conſolation to the faithfull Servants of Chriſt, that their diſpenſing of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel through the Concurrence of the Spirit is made ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual for the Converſion and Salvation of any Soul.</hi> Ay, ſaith Chriſt here; this ſhall be inſtead of my bodily preſence with you, and it ſhall be as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to you. You are now troubled and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful becauſe I am going away from you, but I will ſend the Comforter to you, and the Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhall aſſiſt you in your Miniſtry, and make it ſucceſsful to convince and convert and ſave Souls, and Chriſt would have them, to look upon it as equivalent to his own bodily preſence, and would be matter of greater Joy and Conſolation to them.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40096:44"/> Look into <hi>Verſe</hi> 12, 22 of this Chapter, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>You are now ſad and ſorrowful, but I tell you,</hi> (ſaith He) <hi>the time is coming that your ſorrows ſhall be forgotten:</hi> The ſorrows that you have upon my departure ſhall be forgotten, they ſhall be ſwallowed up with Joy and Conſolation: Look, ſaith he, as it is with a Woman when ſhe draweth near the time of her Travail, when her pains begin to come upon her, then ſhe is ſad and ſorrowful, but, ſaith he, when ſhe is delivered, ſhe forgetteth her ſorrow, for Joy that a man-child is born —: ſo ſhall it be with you. Thus Chriſt comforts his Diſciples againſt his going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, they ſhould have ſuch matter of rejoycing that ſhould ſwallow up all their ſorrows, they ſhould have the preſence of the Spirit, and their Miniſtry ſhould be efficacious and ſucceſsful for the converting of Souls, and Chriſt did ſpeak it from his own experience, <hi>John</hi> 4. When he was ſpeaking to the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> he ſent his Diſciples into the City to buy food, for he was hungry, and when he ſat down weary on the Well, he asked a little water of the woman, and ſo fell a diſcourſing and convincing of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that ſhe lived in Adultery, and converted the woman, and when his Diſciples came, <hi>Maſter,</hi> ſay they, <hi>here is meat to eat: Meat,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have that which is better than meat, I have meat to eat which you know not of; my Meat is to do the Will of my Father;</hi> here is my joy and rejoycing to convert Souls. Meat is matter of great joy to an hungry man, if you give him all the World, if he have not meat it is nothing; ſaith Chriſt, I take more joy and delight in converting of Souls,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40096:44"/> than I do in eating when I am an hungry. And you ſhall ſee how the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth rejoyce in this, that he was an Inſtrument in converting and ſaving of Souls, he writing to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 1 Epiſt. 2.19, 20. <hi>For what is our Joy, or Hope, or Crown of rejoycing? are not even ye in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming? for ye are our Glory and our Joy;</hi> ye (ſaith he) are the Top of my Joy, the Crown of my Joy; <hi>Paul</hi> had been an Inſtrument to convert them by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, and, ſaith he, ye are the top of my glory and rejoycing; So, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>We are bound to give God thanks always for you, my Brethren, and Beloved in the Lord; becauſe God hath from the beginning choſen you unto Salvation, through the Sanctification of the Spirit, and Belief of the Truth, whereunto he called you by my Goſpel, to the obtaining the Glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Saith he, we are always bound to give thanks to God for you; Ay, here is matter of Joy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing. And truly ſo, though <hi>Paul</hi> did meet with Afflictions, Tribulations, and Perſecutions for preaching of the Goſpel, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he made nothing of all his troubles, ſufferings and ſorrows, in regard he did but finiſh his Courſe with Joy. If he have but this Joy and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, I care not, ſaith he, what troubles or afflictions do abide me, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.24. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth in every City, that bonds and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons abide me; but none of theſe things move me, neither count</hi> I <hi>my life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I may finiſh my Courſe with Joy and the Miniſtry which I have received of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> If I can but preach the Goſpel, ſaith he, and be an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40096:45"/> to convert Souls, this is the Joy of my heart, let my life go for it. And it is a very high expreſſion which the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> hath <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3. <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. ſaith he there, <hi>I have no greater joy,</hi> (mark) the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> that had ſuch Communion with Chriſt; Yet ſaith he, <hi>I have no greater joy than to hear that my Children walk in the Truth;</hi> Thoſe that he had been a means and Inſtrument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert by his preaching, now to ſee that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion was true and real by their continuing in the truth: I have no greater Joy in this world, ſaith he; And why ſo, I pray? Why ſhould this be ſuch a matter of Joy and rejoycing to the hearts of the faithful Servants that their Miniſtry is made effectual for the Converſion of Souls?</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Upon this Account, becauſe, <hi>Here is a Sign and Token that God hath bleſſed their Miniſtry,</hi> that the Bleſſing of God from Heaven hath been upon their labours: and I pray let me appeal to your ſelves, is it not matter of Comfort Joy and Rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to you that you find your labours and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to have any Succeſs, to be bleſſed of God? As now, take a Nurſe that brings up a Child, and ſhe ſees the child begins to thrive by her ſuckling of it, and it is the Joy and Rejoycing of her heart; as on the other ſide, if ſhe ſee the Child pine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and doth not proſper, 'tis the grief of her heart, when ſhe takes all this pains and no good comes of it. When you plant and ſow ſeed, if you take any pains in your Orchard or Garden in grafting and the like, and you find that your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is made fruitful, is it not a Comfort to you to go into your Garden, and ſee the ſeed that you have ſown flouriſh and come up? It is rejoycing
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40096:45"/> to you; and much more is it to the hearts of the faithful Servants of Chriſt that their labours in the Miniſtry are bleſſed and made fruitful and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful; becauſe now here is the more immediate preſence of God upon their labours, here is the bleſſing, the bleſſing of God doth more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately appear in their labours. Now in ſowing of Seed there is inſtrumental means and cauſes of its growing, there is Dew, and Showers, and Rain from Heaven, there is the influence of the Sun, the fatneſs of the Soil, that concur to cauſe it grow; but now there is much againſt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Word to work upon the heart; there is the corruption of the heart, and the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Satan and the World, and all to hinder the Goſpel from taking effect, but now when the Lord makes the Goſpel to take effect, to become effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious to the Converſion of Souls, of poor Creatures, here is now the bleſſing of Heauen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his labours, and now he hath cauſe to rejoyce greatly that God is with him, and hath bleſſed his labours, and now God doth own him as a Fellow-Labourer together with himſelf, <hi>We are Workers together with God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>We are Gods Husband men,</hi> and we are planting for God, and God goes along with us and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operates with us; what a mighty cauſe of rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing is this? that we have the preſence of God with us, and the bleſſing of God upon us; nay, it is an argument and token that God owns their Miniſtry and labour, and he ſeals their Miniſtry and Labour, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Ye are the Seal of our Miniſtry;</hi> this is I ſay matter of great Joy and Conſolation in regard it is a Sign
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40096:46"/> and Token that God hath bleſſed the Labours of his Servants, and owned their Miniſtry.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. 'Tis a matter of great Joy and Conſolation, becauſe now, <hi>Here is a Teſtimony that Jeſus Chriſt in Heaven and in his Glory is mindful of his poor Servants here below in the World, he doth mind and remember ſuch a poor Servant of his, that labours in his Name, and doth ſend down the Spirit to accompany him in his Labours;</hi> as Chriſt ſaid here to his Diſciples, <hi>I will ſend the Comforter and he ſhall aſſiſt you,</hi> and I will remember you, when I am in Heaven, I will not forget you. Thus Chriſt now ſends down the Comforter, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from Heaven to aſſiſt ſuch a poor Miniſter in his labours and endeavours; what matter of Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is this to think that Chriſt from Heaven ſends down his Spirit to co-operate with him in his indeavours? What matter of Joy and Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is this? Take but one more.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>It muſt needs be matter of great Joy and Conſolation to the faithful Servants of Chriſt, to think that the Lord ſhould pleaſe to make uſe of ſuch as they are to be Inſtruments in his hands to pull down the Kingdome of the Devil, and to inlarge the Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> That the Devils Kingdom and power ſhould go down, and that Souls ſhould be drawn out of his Kingdom by the Labours of his poor Servants, what Joy is this? When Chriſt ſent his Diſciples to preach, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.17, 18 it is ſaid, <hi>They returned again rejoycing,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The Devils are ſubject to us:</hi> Ay, ſaith Chriſt, I beheld Satan fall down from Heaven like Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Where the Goſpel comes, there goes ſuch a Preſence of the Spirit with the preaching thereof
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40096:46"/> that Sathan goes down, and poor Souls are brought out from under his power and Dominion; as you know Chriſt told <hi>Paul,</hi> that he ſhould be inſtrumental to turn people from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan to God; though they be under the Kingdom and Power of the Devil, yet by the preaching of the Goſpel, when the Spirit concurs and goes along with it, poor Souls are tranſlated from the Kingdom of Satan into the Kingdom of his dear Son, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. Now what Joy and Comfort muſt this needs be to the hearts of the faithful Servants of Chriſt? that the Lord ſhould pleaſe to make them Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in his own hands to pull down the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Devil and to inlarge his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that ſuch ſhall be added to the Lord as ſhall be ſaved? I ſay it muſt needs be matter of Joy and Rejoycing: But I would haſten to an end. Briefly therefore by way of Application.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Application.</hi> And here I might in the firſt place take occaſion to ſpeak a Word of Direction to the Miniſters of Chriſt, if it were a fit place and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, namely, to direct us how we may ſo preach that we may have moſt Joy and Conſolation. <hi>The faithfull Servants of Chriſt have more Joy and Conſolation by being inſtrumental for the Converſion and Salvation of Souls, than by all that ever the People of their Congregation can do for them;</hi> If they may be inſtrumental in the Lords hand for their Converſion and Salvation, this is more Joy and Conſolation to them, than any thing in the World can be. Chriſt tells his Diſciples that this would be matter of Joy and Rejoycing to their Hearts when he was gone from them,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40096:47"/> therefore we ſhould ſeek to convert and ſave Souls, we ſhould do, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I ſeek not yours, but you;</hi> we ſhould ſeek the Converſion and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Souls, and therefore we ſhould be preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Faith and of Repentance, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and Repentance towards God, whereby poor Souls may be converted and ſaved:</hi> And we had need be much in pleading with God for the Spirit, that the Spirit of the Lord may go along with our Miniſtry: Our Sermons had need to be watered and ſoaked in earneſt prayer for the Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here is now a mighty Word of Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto poor Souls to be ready to entertain and receive the Goſpel, and the Miniſtration of it; to be ready ſo to receive it into your hearts as it may be a good Word of Converſion and Salvation to your Souls. Ay, this would be matter of Joy and Rejoycing to the Servants of Chriſt more than all that ever you can do for them, if they may be but inſtrumental for the Converſion and Salvation of your Souls, it will be more Comfort and joy to them than all the World beſides; Joy to them, Ay, it will be Joy to the very Angels in Heaven, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.10, 11. <hi>There ſhall be Joy in Heaven over one Ein<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>; and do not you think, you your ſelves will have as much cauſe of Joy
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40096:47"/> and Rejoycing? Whereas on the other ſide, if ſo be the poor Servants of Chriſt do come and take pains; they ſtudy, and labour, and hold forth the Word of the Goſpel to you, and people come and receive it into their ears, and not into their hearts; no good done upon them, but they remain as carnal, as worldly and unbelieving as before, and they ſee no fruit of their Miniſtry; this is the grief of their hearts and Souls, they labour and labour and queſtion whether the Lord doth own their Miniſtry or no; they have cauſe to complain as the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.6. <hi>I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my Strength for naught and in vain.</hi> So the poor Servants of Chriſt go with a dead heart into their Studies, and come to preach with a ſad heart, when they ſee no good done, no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Work wrought; this is a very Cut to their hearts and Souls, and they would rather (if they might have their wills) ceaſe mentioning of the Name of Chriſt to people. Therefore let it be the deſire, and endeavour, and care of people ſo to hear and receive the Word into their hearts that it may become effectual, and an Inſtrument in the Lords hand for the Converſion and Salvation of their Souls.</p>

                  <p>Do you deſire to have the Word of God made effectual for the convincing and converting and ſaving of your Souls? Then</p>

                  <p>I fear, Brethren, that people are careleſs in this Point, they come reeking out of the World and from their buſineſs, and never wreſtle with the Lord for the preſence of his Spirit to aſſiſt the Preaching of the Word, that it may become ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual and profitable to your Souls, and ſo you go away as you come. Therefore I ſay, as the Apoſtle, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 24. <hi>Be building up your ſelves in your moſt holy Faith.</hi> But how ſhall we build up our ſelves in our moſt holy Faith? how ſhall we do it? why, ſaith he, <hi>Praying in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> that is the way: Beg earneſtly for the Spirit, for the Holy Ghoſt to accompany the Word, and make the Word profitable and effectual to you. That is one Direction, I do but name it, I pray remember it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As we do deſire to have the Word made ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40096:48"/> for Conviction, Converſion, and Salvation to our Souls, <hi>Then attend upon the Preaching of the Goſpel as the Lords Ordinance,</hi> for that very End that he hath appointed it, namely, for Converſion and Salvation. This is the very End for which God hath appointed the Preaching of the Goſpel, to be a ſaving Word, a Word of Salvation to poor Souls, that is the very End of the Goſpel, it is appointed for that End. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Chriſt when he aſcended up on high, he gave Gifts to men,</hi> Miniſterial Gifts, he gave Paſtors, and Teachers, for the edifying of the Body, for the bringing home of Souls to the Body, for the perfecting of the Saints: So that thoſe that are Saints ſhould ſtill attend upon the Goſpel for more edifying, for the ſaving work to be carried on. This is the very Intendment of the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel, God hath ordained it for this end and purpoſe, therefore wait upon it for that end, attend upon it as the Word of God which he hath appointed for that end. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. <hi>We are always bound to give thanks to God for you, beloved Brethren, becauſe when you heard the Word, you received it not as the Word of man, but as it is indeed the Word of God, which worketh effectually in them that believe.</hi> Ay, receive it as the Word, and the Word of God, for that End that God hath appointed it, and through the preſence of the Spirit it will become effectual. Mark how it wrought in <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Family, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. <hi>Cornelius</hi> was directed to ſend for <hi>Peter</hi> to preach to him, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> in the mean time had gathered together the Congregation, his Friends and Relations; he had got them together that they
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40096:49"/> might hear the Goſpel as well as himſelf, when <hi>Peter</hi> came he preached Chriſt to them; <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith <hi>Cornelius, we are all here before the Lord, to hear whatever God hath directed thee to ſpeak to us,</hi> we are here to attend upon it as the very Word of God; and <hi>Peter</hi> opened his mouth and preached the Goſpel to them, and it is ſaid <hi>The Holy Ghoſt fell upon them all that heard it, v.</hi> 44. and then ſaith <hi>Peter, verſe</hi> 47. <hi>Can any man forbid Water that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we.</hi> Attending upon the Preaching of the Goſpel as Gods Ordinance and Inſtitution, for ſaving ends and purpoſes, for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and Edification, and Salvation; this is the way whereby we may have the Goſpel made effectual to us, we ſhall be brought to receive it, and receiving of it, we ſhall be brought into a ſtate of Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and further built up in our moſt holy Faith: That is the ſecond Direction.</p>

               <p>YOU have heard the ſcope of theſe words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, which in ſhort is this. Chriſt would here comfort his Diſciples againſt their ſorrow, which they had for his going away from them; <hi>Becauſe I ſaid theſe things unto you,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row hath filled your hearts.</hi> Now Chriſt is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here in a way of Comfort, to ſuſtain and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the hearts of his Diſciples againſt that grief and ſorrow that did poſſeſs them; And how doth he comfort them? He tells them, that his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al preſence ſhall be more advantagious to them than his bodily preſence could be: The preſence of the Spirit which he would ſend to them (ſaith he) he ſhall be a Comforter to you. <hi>If I go away, I will ſend the Comforter to you;</hi> and that ſhall be more than my bodily preſence to you; whereas, <hi>If I go not away, the Comforter will not come.</hi> Ay, but how ſhall the preſence of the Spirit be in ſtead of Chriſt's bodily preſence to them, and make up that loſs to them? Chriſt tells them, for that
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40096:51"/> wherein the preſence of the Spirit with them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his going away, would be equivalent and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent to his own bodily perſonal being with them. But wherein? He tells them, namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when the Spirit comes, he ſhall co work with them in their Miniſtry, ſo as their Miniſtry ſhall be made efficacious and effectual to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of the Salvation of many Souls: The Spirit ſhall go along with their Miniſtry; and this Chriſt gives in by way of Comfort to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>Hence, we Obſerved the laſt time, <hi>That it is matter of exceeding great Joy and Conſolation to the faithful Servants of Chriſt, that through the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and co-working of the Spirit, their Miniſtry is made effectual for the good of Souls.</hi> This is a great matter of joy and rejoycing; for obſerve it, Chriſt doth lay this down as a comfort to preponderate and out-weigh their ſorrow that they had in their hearts, in reſpect of his going away from them. But I ſhall not ſpeak to any thing that was then ſpoken to.</p>
               <p>But ſtill it may be ſaid, <hi>But how ſhall the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit concur with our Miniſtry to make it effectual for the Converſion and Salvation of Souls?</hi> Saith Chriſt, <hi>When he is come he ſhall convince the World.</hi> The preſence of the Spirit with your Miniſtry ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Men of the world: Convince them, Of what? Now here he tells them.</p>
               <p>You heard in the general from the <hi>8th Verſe, He ſhall convince the World of Sin, and of Righteouſneſs, and of Judgement.</hi> But now in theſe 9, 10, and 11 <hi>Verſes,</hi> he comes to ſhew particularly the work of the Spirit in convincing the World, and he gives
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40096:51"/> the reaſon of every particular that the Spirit ſhall convince the World of. <hi>Of Sin, Becauſe they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not in me.</hi> And again, He ſhall convince the world, <hi>of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Why? <hi>Becauſe I go to the Father, and ye ſee me no more;</hi> And again, He ſhall convince the world <hi>of Judgment,</hi> Why? <hi>Becauſe the Prince of this World is judged.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall ſpeak only to the firſt of theſe at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent through the Lords aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſhall convince the world of Sin; Of Sin,</hi> and this in order to their Converſion and Salvation, Why? Becauſe Chriſt ſpeaks this by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation to the hearts of the Diſciples; now this would be matter of Comfort indeed, that their Miniſtry ſhould be made efficacious for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Salvation of Souls; Therefore this convincing the world of Sin, is in order to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>There are two Points to be ſpoken to from the <hi>Verſe;</hi> But I ſhall only take up one to ſpeak to at preſent through the Lords aſſiſtance, and that is this.</p>

                     <p>That it is the firſt work of the Spirit of God in order to the Converſion and Salvation of any Soul, to convince the Soul of Sin.</p>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>I ſay, the firſt work of the Spirit of God in order to Converſion and Salvation of Souls, is to convince of Sin. For, here Chriſt ſpeakes of the work of the Spirit, in order to Converſion and Salvation, and, what ſhall he do in order to it? Saith he, He ſhall convince the world of Sin; and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40096:52"/> this ſhall be the firſt work that the Spirit ſhall do. He ſpeaks of convincing <hi>of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>of Judgement;</hi> but the firſt work that the Spirit ſhall do, ſhall be to convince <hi>of Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are four things that are neceſſary to be ſpoken to for the opening and clearing of this great Truth and Point.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew what the convincing work of the Spirit is, what it is for the Spirit to convince a Soul <hi>of Sin,</hi> that we may underſtand it, and be clear in it; for it is that which is in order to our Converſion and Salvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Shew you, That the convincing of a Soul of <hi>Sin,</hi> is a neceſſary work in order to Salvation; for here Chriſt ſpeaks of the Spirits convincing the Soul of Sin in order to Salvation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Convincing of a Soul of Sin, is the work of the Spirit; no leſs than the work of the Spirit. For, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>The Comforter ſhall come, and when he is come, he ſhall convince the world of ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Shew you, That convincing a Soul <hi>of Sin,</hi> is the firſt work of the Spirit, in order to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and Salvation of any Soul.</p>
               <p>I ſuppoſe I ſhall not be able to go through all theſe things at preſent, but to begin and go as far as we can. Well,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then, <hi>Let us enquire what is the convincing of Sin, and wherein it lies?</hi> You ſhall find in Scripture, that this convincing <hi>of Sin,</hi> is ſet forth by various expreſſions, ſometimes 'tis expreſſed by <hi>Pricking the heart,</hi> ſo <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. <hi>When they heard this, they were pricked at the heart.</hi> Sometimes it is called <hi>the wounding of the Spirit,</hi> ſo Prov. 18.14. Sometimes it is expreſſed by the <hi>ſticking of an
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40096:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> Arrow in a mans Spirit, Pſal.</hi> 38.2. <hi>Thy Arrows ſtick faſt in me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David;</hi> which is nothing elſe but the ſenſe of ſin, the guilt of ſin; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is expreſſed by <hi>the breaking of Bones, Pſal.</hi> 51.18. <hi>That the Bones which thou haſt broken may rejoyce;</hi> It was upon the Conviction of his ſin of Murder and Adultery. And ſometimes 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by <hi>the ſmiting of the heart;</hi> as 'tis ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5. when he had cut off the Skirt of <hi>Saul</hi>'s garment. <hi>His heart ſmote him,</hi> he was convinced of his ſin.</p>
               <p>But more particularly, Wherein doth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Sin lye? Now you ſhall find that it lies eſpecially in three things, or there are three things in a real convincing of ſin.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The firſt is a ſetting of ſin before the Soul;</hi> the ſetting of it home upon the heart, or the bringing of <hi>Sin</hi> to remembrance: ſetting of it before the Soul, as <hi>David</hi> d th expreſs it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3. ſaith he, <hi>My ſin is ever before me,</hi> 'tis before my face; he was convinced of his guilt, and then he had ſin ſet before him. So when <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet came to <hi>David</hi> to convince him of his <hi>ſin,</hi> when he was impenitent, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.7. ſee there how <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet ſets his <hi>Sin</hi> in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, that he might well ſay, <hi>My Sin is always before me.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36, 37. <hi>Peter,</hi> to convince the <hi>Jews</hi> of their <hi>ſin,</hi> ſets their <hi>ſin</hi> before them, and tells them what they had done, <hi>They had killed Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of God, the Lord of glory; and when they heard that, they were pricked at the heart:</hi> So, that it is one thing in Conviction of <hi>Sin,</hi> when the Spirit doth convince of <hi>ſin,</hi> he ſets the <hi>ſin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soul, or upon the heart; for if ſo be <hi>ſin</hi>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:40096:53"/> be not ſet home, and brought before the Soul, there can be no conviction of <hi>ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, There is this further in Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sin, namely, <hi>Sin is ſo ſet home upon the heart, as that the heart is not able to avoid the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction:</hi> The heart is not able to ſhift away from under the power of it, all the ſhifts and endeavours of the Soul cannot get it off; when the Spirit ſets home Sin upon the heart, 'tis ſo ſet home, as that the Soul cannot now put it off, it cannot ſhake it off: the Arrow is ſo ſhot, that the Soul cannot wriggle from it. 'Tis true indeed, a guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience doth not love to be convinced of Sin, and therefore obſerve it, whenever the Lord goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to convince of Sin, the Soul doth endeavour all it can to put off the blow, as you ſhall ſee now when the Lord came to convince <hi>Adam,</hi> our firſt Parents of their Sin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.12, 13. They had tranſgreſſed and thereupon hid themſelves: well, the Lord called for them, <hi>Adam<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where art thou?</hi> at laſt <hi>Adam</hi> appears, and there the Lord to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him of his Sin, ſets his Sin before him; <hi>What haſt thou done</hi> (ſaith God)? <hi>haſt thou eaten of the Tree that I forbad thee?</hi> He could not deny it: But, pray, obſerve what evaſions they had, if it were poſſible they would avoid the dint of the Conviction; ſaith <hi>Adam,</hi> 'Tis true, I have eaten of the Tree, but it was by inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Wife, <hi>The Woman which thou gaveſt me, ſhe gave me of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ree, and I did eat;</hi> and thus he avoided the power of the Conviction; Well, he goeth to the Woman, and ſaid, <hi>What is this that thou haſt done?</hi> and ſhe put it off too; <hi>The Serpent beguiled me, and I did eat;</hi> Thus a guilty
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40096:53"/> Conſcience will ſhift off Convictions as long as it can. You ſhall ſee <hi>Aaron,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> was abſent forty days and from the people, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.23, 24. <hi>Aaron</hi> and the people made a Golden Calf to worſhip; when <hi>Moſes</hi> came down from the Mount, he fell to expoſtulating with <hi>Aaron</hi> about his Sin; he would convince <hi>Aaron</hi> of his great Sin; ſaith <hi>Moſes, What did the people unto thee that thou haſt brought ſo great a Sin upon them?</hi> Now mark, how <hi>Aaron</hi> would avoid the dint of this Conviction: <hi>It is true,</hi> ſaith he, he could not deny the thing, <hi>but let not the anger of my Lord wax hot; thou knoweſt the people, that they are ſet upon miſchief;</hi> it is the peoples fault, ſaith he, <hi>for they ſaid, make us Gods that they may go before us, for as for this Moſes we know not what is become of him. And I ſaid unto them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſoever hath any Gold, let them break it off: ſo they gave it me: then I caſt it into the Fire, and there came out this Calf.</hi> What a pitiful excuſe was here? he did bur throw it into the fire and there came out a Calf; See what ſhifts Good men will have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (for <hi>Aaron</hi> wa a good man) to put off the power and force of Conviction.</p>
               <p>You ſhall ſee another Inſtance in <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.9. There God had ſent <hi>Saul</hi> to cut off all the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> Men, Women, and Children, and Cattel and all, <hi>Spare none, ſaith God:</hi> Well, God give him victory over the <hi>Amalekites</hi> and he made a great ſlaughter indeed, but <hi>Saul</hi> ſpared <hi>Agag</hi> the King, and ſome of the beſt of the Cattel, at the <hi>13th Verſe, And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul ſaid unto him, Bleſſed be thou of the Lord I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Commandment of the Lord:</hi> The Lord
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40096:54"/> knows, ſaith he, I have done the will and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Lord, he would not be convinced at firſt; well, ſaith <hi>Samuel,</hi> to convince him, <hi>Verſe</hi> 14. <hi>What meaneth then the bleating of the Sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the Oxen, which I hear?</hi> Well, <hi>Saul</hi> could not deny but there was ſome of the Oxen ſpared, and the beſt of the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel ſpared, but he had his excuſe for that, <hi>verſe</hi> 15. <hi>The People</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>ſpared the beſt of the Sheep, and of the Oxen, to ſacrifice unto the Lord:</hi> Thus he would not be convinced: At laſt <hi>Samuel</hi> was fain to fall upon him with down right blows, and thunder againſt him to ſtrike him down. <hi>I tell you,</hi> ſaith he <hi>v.</hi> 22, 23. <hi>here is rebellion againſt God, and rebellion is as the Sin of witchcraft, and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſs is as iniquity and idolatry:</hi> And at the laſt he was brought down, and fell under the Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>v.</hi> 24. <hi>And Saul ſaid to Samuel, I have ſinned, and tranſgreſſed the Commandment of the Lord, and thy Words; becauſe I feared the people:</hi> But you ſee what a deal of Do there was to bring <hi>Saul</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of the Conviction; he ſtood upon his Juſtification. Juſt thus it is with a poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as long as he can ſtand out againſt Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he will put it off; as it is with a Malefactor at the Bar, as long as he can, he will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced; he will plead, <hi>Not guilty;</hi> and juſtify himſelf, either by denying or mincing of it, or one thing or other, till the Evidence come clear againſt him; then his mouth is ſtopt; then he is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: Thus it is with a poor Sinner, the Lord brings his ſin before him, if he can he will deny it, and excuſe himſelf: But now when the Holy Ghoſt comes to convince of ſin, he ſtops the mouth, that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40096:54"/> he ſhall have nothing to plead to excuſe himſelf: As, I remember, 'tis the Apoſtles expreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. <hi>That every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the World may become guilty before God;</hi> ſo convinced, that the Sinner may have nothing to ſay, to juſtify him before God. This is another thing in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction; when Sin is not only ſet before the Soul, but ſo ſet home, that the Soul hath nothing to ſay to clear it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is a third Thing in a true Conviction of ſin; namely, When the Soul is really convinced by the Spirit of ſin, it hath not only ſin ſet before it, and ſo ſet before it, as the mouth is ſtopped, and ſilenced, that it cannot plead <hi>Not guilty: But, where there is a true Conviction of Sin, the heart is affected with it, and afflicted for it.</hi> And this is intimated by thoſe expreſſions you heard before, whereby the Holy Ghoſt doth ſet out Conviction of Sin, as it is ſet out by the ſhooting of an Arrow. Now, if an Arrow ſtick in the fleſh, it will put it to pain, it will make the fleſh ake; if there be a Prick at the heart, you will certainly be ſenſible of it, if a Bone be broken, there will be grief, and trouble, and affliction: Truly, thus it is in this work of Conviction of Sin, when the Spirit doth convince a Soul of Sin, it doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet ſin before him, and alſo ſet ſin ſo home, as the Soul cannot juſtify it ſelf, but now the Soul falls down under it, and is affected and afflicted with it; and therefore hence it is, that ſometimes when a Soul is convinced of Sin, it is affected with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and aſtoniſhment. He even trembles to think he ſhould be guilty of ſuch a ſin; as I remember, 'tis ſaid concerning the Jaylor, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.26. <hi>He
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40096:55"/> came in trembling before Paul and Silas;</hi> it is ſaid, he ſprang in, and came trembling; there was an Earth-quake, and that Earth-quake was an Heart-quake to him, it made his heart ſhake, and he ſaw himſelf in a damned condition, and now, ſaith he, <hi>Sirs, What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> he came in trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling before <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> ſaying, <hi>What ſhall I do?</hi> And ſometimes 'tis expreſſed by ſhame and bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Soul is even aſhamed and confounded, when ſin is ſet home, as you know it was the ſpeech of <hi>Ephraim, Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19. <hi>He was aſhamed and confounded for his rebellion, he was ſo like a Heifer, unaccuſtomed to the Yoke:</hi> he could not bear the Lords Yoke, and when the Lord came to tame him, then he was aſhamed, as <hi>Ezra</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed and bluſh before thee, Ezra,</hi> 9.6. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with grief, and ſorrow, and mourning; as when <hi>Paul</hi> had convinced the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of their ſin in ſuffering the inceſtuous perſon amongſt them, without bearing teſtimony againſt him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. <hi>What Carefulneſs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>it wrought in you? What Sorrow? what godly Sorrow ye had amongſt you?</hi> Ay, they were convinced, and then they mourned and ſorrowed. And ſo, ſometimes the heart is as it were all a-mort, when the Soul is convinced of Sin, the heart is even dead, and knows not what to do: ſaith <hi>Paul, When the Commandment came, Sin revived, and I died, Rom</hi> 7. I ſaw my ſelf a dead man, his heart was even dead. Well, thus you ſee what Conviction of Sin is, and wherein it lies, it conſiſts in theſe three, or theſe three things do concur to a real Conviction of Sin, namely, A ſetting of ſin before the Soul, and ſo ſetting it home that the Soul cannot deny it, but
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40096:55"/> muſt fall down under it, and be affected and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with it. Now, leaſt any poor Soul may have a ſtumbling Block laid before it, let me only intimate this: That there are degrees of convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of ſin, all are not in a like meaſure convinced of Sin, ſome are convinced more, and others leſs; as now, ſome that have had civil Education, that have not lived in notorious and groſs ſins, and wickedneſs; their Convictions poſſibly may be more ſilent, and not make ſo great a noiſe as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of others do; as <hi>Lydia,</hi> ſhe lived without breaking into notorious and groſs wickedneſſes, and you ſee there was no great noiſe of her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Sin, though convinced of Sin ſhe was; and there is a neceſſity of that, as you wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Truth is, <hi>It is not poſſible to determine a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular degree of convincing of Sin for every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon,</hi> and therefore I ſhall give you this as a Rule to know when your convincing of Sin is ſufficient; namely, <hi>then convincing of ſin is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent when as a Soul is ſo convinced of ſin, as that now it is wholly taken off from all hopes of being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by any thing in its ſelf, and it is made now to look towards Chriſt, and the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt;</hi> though poſſibly in a weak manner, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it is taken off from looking to any thing in it ſelf, or hoping in any thing it ſelf, to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward its own ſalvation: it is cut off from that by being convinced of Sin; now I cannot help my ſelf, I cannot ſave my ſelf, by all that ever I can do, <hi>What ſhall I do?</hi> as they in the <hi>Acts, Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sirs, What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> They were at their wits end, they ſaw nothing that they could do, could ſave their Souls.

But to come to the ſecond thing, namely, to ſhew you, <hi>That convincing of Sin, is a thing that is neceſſary in order to Converſion and Salvation.</hi> That it is neceſſary, doth plainly appear thus, namely, Why elſe is it made to be the work of the Spirit, if convincing of ſin be not neceſſary, would the Spirit convince of ſin?

                  <p>Again, If ſo be that generally all that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and ſaved, have found a work of convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon their hearts, then certainly it is neceſſary in order to converſion and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>And again, (not to multiply things of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) If this work of convincing of ſin be not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, To what end elſe ſerves the Law? Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? Is the Law ſin? God forbid: Nay, I had not known ſin, but by the Law; I had not known Luſt, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi> And at the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Verſe, I was alive without the Law once, but when the Commandment came, ſin revived, and I died: Wherefore the Law is holy, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment holy, juſt and good.</hi> The Law (ſaith he) is good, the Law is juſt and holy, it is not in vain; But, Wherefore ſerves the Law? It is to convince of ſin: Then conviction of ſin is neceſſary: and ſo the Apoſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Gal. 3.19. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then ſerves the Law?</hi> There's the Queſtion; <hi>It was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſions, till the Seed ſhould come.</hi> And then at the 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon manifold accounts and regards.</hi> I ſhall name ſome,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Convincing of ſin is neceſſary in order to ſalvation, <hi>Becauſe except a ſoul be convinced of ſin, it will hardly ever come to Chriſt.</hi> And, that is neceſſary, for a Soul to come to Chriſt, that is neceſſary for ſalvation. Now a Soul that is not convinced of ſin, will hardly ever come to Chriſt, he will make any ſhift in the world before he will come to Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.43.44. It is ſaid of the Woman that had the <hi>Iſſue of Blood, At laſt ſhe came to Chriſt;</hi> but mark, ſhe made all the ſhift ſhe could, before ſhe would come; ſhe had it twelve years, and ſhe ſpent every penny ſhe had, ſhe ſpent all her Living on Phyſitians, to cure her diſtemper, and when all was gone, and there was no other way to help her, then ſhe came to Chriſt: So, till a Soul be convinced of ſin, it will never come to Chriſt; this is the courſe of ſinners, until they be convinced of the neceſſity they will not come, <hi>John</hi> 5.40. Saith Chriſt, <hi>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life.</hi> No, the ſoul will look to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40096:57"/> find the Life in its own hands, by its own works and endeavours, by its Prayers and Duties —: He will not come to Chriſt that he might have Life; And therefore when Chriſt doth tender grace and mercy to ſinners, Alas! they ſlight it and deſpiſe it, becauſe they have not been convinced. You ſhall ſee there, <hi>John</hi> 8.32, and ſo on, Chriſt is directing of the <hi>Jews</hi> how they might be freed from ſin, how they might have their freedom, Saith Chriſt, <hi>If the Son therefore make you free, you ſhall be free indeed.</hi> Now mark, What do they account of Chriſt's freedom, or directions to come to him, to be made free? <hi>Verſe</hi> 33. Say they, <hi>We are Abrahams Seed, and were never in Bondage</hi> to any man, we are free enough; they were never convinced of the bondage of ſin, therefore now the offer of Chriſt to free them, is of no account with them. The ſoul that is not convinced of ſin, cares not for Chriſts tenders and offers of Grace, <hi>John</hi> 9.39, 40. Chriſt is there directing the Jews to come to him to have their blind eyes opened, they were ſpiritually blind, and ſaith Chriſt, <hi>For Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment am I come into the World, that they which ſee not might ſee, and they which ſee might be made blind.</hi> Well, thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> they were not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of their ſpiritual blindneſs, and therefore they make a tuſh at it, What? Doſt thou come to cure our blindneſs? to make us ſee? <hi>Are we blind alſo</hi> (ſay they), they ſcorned his words; becauſe they were not convinced of ſin, they cared not for coming to Chriſt for any grace or any mercy, and therefore when Chriſt would have a Soul to come to him for any grace or mercy, he takes this courſe with them, namely, firſt to convince them of their
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40096:58"/> ſinful eſtate, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19, 20. Chriſt doth counſel them there to come to him for Eye-ſalve, that they might See, and for Gold, that they might be rich, and for white Raiment, that they might be clothed; but now before Chriſt doth make this tender to them, he doth firſt take a courſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of their ſin; <hi>Thou ſaiſt,</hi> (ſaith he to the Church of <hi>Laodiced) that thou art rich, and wanteſt nothing; but I tell thee,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that thou art poor, and miſerable, and wretched, and blind, and naked; and therefore now I counſel thee, to come and buy Eye-ſalve of me, and Gold, and white Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> So that this is the way that Chriſt takes when he would have a ſoul to come to him, he convinces him firſt of ſin. Therefore this is one ground or reſpect why conviction of ſin is ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to ſalvation, becauſe elſe a Soul will never be willing to come to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs a Soul be convinced of ſin, Chriſt is not willing to come to that Soul, to ſave that Soul.</hi> I ſay, Chriſt is not willing to ſave a ſoul that is not convinced of Sin, and therefore ſaith Chriſt (mark I pray) <hi>The Whole need not the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, but thoſe that are ſick.</hi> Mat. 9.12. <hi>I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance:</hi> Chriſt came not to call them that are no ſinners to repentance, And who are theſe? Are not all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? Is not every one a ſinner? There is not a Juſt man upon the Earth, that liveth and ſinneth not; But who are theſe that are Righteous here? <hi>I came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners.</hi> Who are Sinners? By ſinners here, he meanes thoſe that are convinced of their ſinful eſtate; and thoſe Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, that are not convinced; they look upon
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40096:58"/> themſelves as Righteous, though they are as ſinful as any others; yet notwithſtanding they not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced, they look upon themſelves as juſt and righteous; Now, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I come not to call the Righteous, but I come to call Sinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: Sinners,</hi> thoſe that are convinced of ſin, that are ſinners indeed, and know themſelves to be ſinners; I come to call them to repentance, to life and ſalvation; and mark, ſaith Chriſt again, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.10. <hi>I am come to ſeek and to ſave that which is loſt;</hi> I am come to them that are loſt, I come not to ſeek and to ſave them that are not loſt; loſt, you will ſay, Is not every ſinner loſt? ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, 'tis hid to them that are loſt.</hi> Is not every ſinner a loſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? a dead Creature? What, doth Chriſt come to ſeek and to ſave every ſinner in the World? No, ſaith he, <hi>I am come to ſeek and to ſave them that are loſt,</hi> who are they that are loſt? 'tis true, all ſinners are loſt in reſpect of their ſtate and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but every Sinner is not loſt in reſpect of their ſenſe of their loſt condition. I pray when do you look upon a Man or Woman to be loſt? When may one be ſaid to be loſt? I pray, mark, you may obſerve theſe three things in it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When he is gone out of his way, when he hath miſſed his way whither he intends to go, then he is loſt, but not only ſo, But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When he hath not only miſſed his way, and he is out of his way, but alſo when he doth not know the way, how to return into the right way, he doth not know the way back again; you will ſay, now the man is loſt. But</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Further, when a man comes to be ſenſible
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40096:59"/> of this, that he is gone out of his way, and he doth not know which way to return home again, and he is ready to ſit down becauſe he doth not know which way to take, only ſaith he, if I go this way or that way, I may go further out of my way, therefore he is fain to ſit down, and knows not what to do, nor which way to take, ſuch a man is loſt; but if a man be out of the way, and know the way back again, he is not loſt; he may find the way, or if ſo be he be not ſenſible he is out of his way, he is not loſt; but when theſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur together, then he is loſt. Thus it is wi h a ſinner, when he comes to be convinced that he is out of the way of Salvation, and he knows not how to come into the way, and he knows he is like to periſh in this ſtate he is now in, now the ſinner is loſt; Now ſaith Chriſt, This is the poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that I am come to ſeek and to ſave; when a poor ſinner is convinced of his ſinful Eſtate and is ſo loſt, now Chriſt comes to ſeek and to ſave him. Now if a man or woman be not loſt, Chriſt will not come to ſeek &amp; to ſave them <hi>That are loſt,</hi> that is, thoſe that are convinced of their being in a loſt Eſtate. And that is the ſecond Reaſon or Ground why convincing of ſin is neceſſary in order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Chriſt elſe will hardly come to ſeek and to ſave ſuch.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Convincing of Sin is neceſſary in order to Salvation, <hi>Becauſe unleſs a Soul be convinced of ſin, if Chriſt ſhould come to ſave it, it will not be willing to accept of Chriſt,</hi> and receive Chriſt and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Chriſt, he will not be willing withall; no, <hi>Chriſt came to his own, and his own received him not;</hi> He came to the <hi>Jews</hi> that were (as it were) his
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40096:59"/> own Country Men, but they would not receive him: Why? they were not convinced; One that is not ſick, will not care for receiving the Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, or for having the Phyſician to come at him, he hath no need of him: <hi>The Whole need not the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>but they that are ſick.</hi> Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, untill a Soul be convinced of Sin, it is whole and ſound in its own Apprehenſion, and that Soul doth not need the Phyſician: Let Chriſt come and offer himſelf, and tender Life and Salvation, he doth not accept of it, he hath no need of it; and hence it is that Chriſt tenders and offers himſelf in the Goſpel, and offers Salvation therein to poor ſinners; and People, becauſe they are not convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of their need of Chriſt, receive him not: Chriſt comes near to them, and offers himſelf, and Life, and Salvation to them, through himſelf, and by believing on himſelf; Ay, but they will not accept him, nor receive him, they will not cloſe with him; they will not own him though Chriſt come ſo near to them: 'Tis true, Chriſt doth not come ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to ſave thoſe that are not convinced, but he will firſt convince them, and then ſave them. That is the third Argument upon which account Conviction of Sin is neceſſary in order to Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>If a Soul be not convinced of ſin, that Soul will be hardly taken off from its ſins;</hi> it will not part with its ſins, and if it do not part with ſin, it cannot be ſaved; no man can be ſaved with his ſins. I ſay, a Soul that is not convinced of ſin, will not really part with his ſins; 'tis true, a Soul may poſſibly be reſtrained ſometimes, that it dares not venture upon thoſe ſins that it did before, as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40096:60"/> poſſibly through ſome dread, or terror, anguiſh, or fear: poſſibly the Soul hath been amazed, through ſome eminent danger which he hath been in; poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly he hath been ſick to death, nigh to the grave, and hath ſeen the door of Eternity to ſtand open to receive him, he hath been amazed, and now, if the Lord pleaſe he may have his life, he will turn a new man, and forſake thoſe evil ways and courſes he formerly lived in; or if he be in ſome ſudden danger, or accident, that he is amazed and affrighted: O now, he will never do as he hath done, but now, when the danger is over, and the fear is vaniſhed, he is the ſame man he was before. I could give you a ſad ſtory of this, but that I would not take up time that way now, you know how it was with <hi>Balaam,</hi> when <hi>Balak</hi> ſent to him to curſe <hi>Iſrael; Balaam</hi> met with a meſſage from God to the contrary, <hi>Do not go with him,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for it will coſt you your life,</hi> when the Meſſenger came; ſaith <hi>Balaam, If Balak would give me his houſe full of gold and ſilver, I cannot go beyond the Commandment of my God;</hi> yet <hi>Balaam</hi> had an eye to the wages of unrighteouſneſs, and he would try to go, and at laſt ventures to go, he might be reſtrained a while, but he was not really convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of Sin, and on he would go, he would venture at laſt. Juſt as it is with two Lovers, two young people fall in love, and their Parents are againſt their proceedings, and their Parents threaten them, and charge them to come no more at one another; but ſo long as their affections hold, they will find ſome way or other to come together, and though they may for a time be reſtrained, yet they will take ſome occaſion or other to come together
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40096:60"/> again. Thus it is with a ſinner, ſo long as his affections are not taken off from ſin, and till a Soul be convinced of ſin, his affections remain to it, and though it may be affrighted, and reſtrained for a time, yet it will return again: Juſt as it is with a Bowl, it will run on ſo long as the force of the hand remains, but it will return again to its natural Bias; ſo it is with a ſinner, poſſibly he may be under ſome reſtraint through ſome fright and amazement, by ſome eminent danger it is in: but when that fear or fright is over, as long as the affections hold, and were never diſingaged and broken off from ſin, the ſinner will return and be as eager and as violent upon his ſins as before; but when a Soul comes to be really convinced of his ſin, and hath it ſet home upon him, as ſuppoſe it be the prophanation of the Sabbath, or ſuppoſe it be diſobedience to Parents, or ſuppoſe this or that ſin, if a Soul come to be really convinced of it, its affections towards it are broken off, and then it will be ready to ſay with <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hoſ. 4. ult. <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols,</hi> he had been convinced of it, and now, <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> This is the fourth Argument, whereby it doth appear, that this work of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing of ſin is neceſſary in order to Converſion, and Salvation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Convincing of Sin is neceſſary in order to Salvation, <hi>Becauſe unleſs a Soul be really convinced of ſin that Soul can never love Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> never prize Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto them that believe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>he is precious,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.7. That is to you who have been convinced of Sin, and brought off from Sin by the power of the Spirit, convinced of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:40096:61"/> Sin, and drawn to Chriſt, by faith and be ieving through the Spirit; now to you Jeſus Chriſt is precious. O, when a Soul comes to be ſenſible what a loſt creature it is, how undone it is in it ſelf, it will think how much it is engaged, and beholden to Chriſt! O, this is he that I am bound to love for ever; this is he that hath done ſo much for me; if it had not been for Chriſt, I had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed for ever! The Soul when it hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of Sin, and brought off from the love of Sin, and brought to lean upon Chriſt by Faith, now Jeſus Chriſt is lovely and precious to him; and hence you may ſee, what is the reaſon that many Profeſſors that have made a great ſhew in the world, and a great noiſe in the Churches, and yet they have little love to Chriſt, and Jeſus Chriſt is not very precious to them. And poſſibly many complain of it, O that I could love Jeſus Chriſt more (and it is a good complaint I confeſs)! O that he were more precious to me! and what is the reaſon that Jeſus Chriſt is more precious to our Souls? and that the Soul can love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt no more? O! here is one great reaſon, poſſibly the Soul was never really and truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of Sin, the more really the Soul hath been convinced of Sin, the more dear and precious will Jeſus Chriſt be to that Soul.</p>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40096:61"/> grounded, but its Comforts will be up and down: it will be like a houſe that is built upon a ſandy foundation, a light foundation, that hath no depth, and you ſee the danger of that houſe that is built upon the Sands, that hath a ſhallow ſlight foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, it is in danger to tumble, eſpecially when ſtorms come, and great Winds blow, as Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. to our preſent purpoſe, ſaith he, <hi>He that heareth my Words and doth them not, I will liken him to a Builder that built his houſe upon the Sands:</hi> And, ſaith he, <hi>When the Wind blew, and the Rain beat upon the houſe, it fell, becauſe it wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a good Foundation.</hi> Truly, ſo a Soul that hath no ſure Foundation, that is, that was never real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced of ſin, of his need of Chriſt, that Soul will be like a houſe without a Foundation, it will meet with temptations, ſtorms and tempeſts to try what ground it ſtands on; and hence it is, that it comes to be ſo often tottering and ſhaking. I remember a ſpeech of a holy eminent Servant of Chriſt, to ſet out the neceſſity of Conviction of ſin, ſaith he, <hi>The leſs Fine a man pays for his houſe, when he enters, the more Rent he muſt pay afterward.</hi> He meant thus, the leſs Conviction a man hath of ſin at firſt, that is the Fine, the leſs his Fine is, the more Rent he muſt pay afterward, his meaning was this; the more he will be ſubject to Troubles, and Doubts, and Scruples afterwards. A Soul that hath not a real conviction of ſin upon him, that Soul will be unſtable, its Comforts will be unſtable, and though he may hold up his head, ſo long as all is calm, and clear above him, but when the aſſaults of the Devil come, and the powers of Hell are let looſe upon it, to try its Foundation;
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40096:62"/> if the foundation be not deep rooted, all the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will come to nothing; it is like a Plant or Tree that is planted but ſhallow in the Ground, and will be apt to wither, ſo Chriſt compares it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.21. <hi>The Seed that fell upon the ſtony ground, ſprang up for a while, but when the Sun did riſe,</hi> when temptations came, ſcorching temptations, and tribulations, and tryals came, <hi>they withered away, becauſe they wanted depth of earth for the root;</hi> they had no rooting, they were not humbled and convinced of ſin, they took up a Profeſſion, and confeſſed Chriſt, and profeſſed Chriſt, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were truly convinced of ſin; and this is the great reaſon why Profeſſors are ſubject to ſo many doubts and ſcruples about their condition, when they come into ſickneſs and dangers, then they are ready to queſtion their condition; What is the reaſon? why poſſibly this may be one, Becauſe they were never convinced truly of ſin by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. And therefore you ſee now, upon all theſe accounts, That Conviction of ſin is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for ſinners, in order to their Converſion and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>So now, I have finiſhed the ſecond Thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, I ſhould now have come to the third Thing, to ſhew you, That convincing of ſin, is the Work of the Spirit of God. But that and ſome other things, I muſt leave till another oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity.</p>

               <p>YOU have heard the coherence of theſe words before, and therefore I ſhall not trouble you with that; and the Point you may remember what it was, that was laſt propounded from theſe words, Namely,
<q>That it is the very firſt work of the Spirit of God, in order to Salvation, to convince the Soul of Sin.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For ſo Chriſt here is comforting of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples againſt their ſorrow upon his departure from them; and he tels them, That he would ſend the Comforter to them, and he tells them what the Comforter ſhould do, he ſhould aſſiſt them in their Miniſtry, towards the converſion and ſalvation of Souls; and the firſt thing he ſhall do, he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the World of <hi>Sin,</hi> and then of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and then of <hi>Judgement;</hi> but this is his firſt work, to convince the world of <hi>Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:40096:63"/>
               <p>There were four things propounded to be ſpoken to for the clearing of this Point.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew you what we are to underſtand by this Conviction of <hi>Sin,</hi> which is the firſt work of the Spirit, and wherein it lay, and that you heard in three things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You heard the neceſſity of it; why this work of convincing of <hi>Sin</hi> is ſo neceſſary in order to converſion and Salvation. You heard the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it in five or ſix things, upon which account it was neceſſary in order to ſalvation, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of <hi>Sin.</hi> Well, there are two things yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main to be ſpoken to for the opening of this Point.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third thing is to ſhew, that this work of convincing of <hi>Sin,</hi> is the proper work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Nothing ſhort of the Spirit of God, can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and truly convince the ſoul of <hi>Sin,</hi> in order to ſalvation. And then,</p>
               <p n="4">4. That it is not only the work of the Spirit, but the firſt work of the Spirit, in order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>Theſe two things, I ſhall now proceed to, through the Lords aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Well then, we are to fall upon the third to make it evident to you, that the work of convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of <hi>Sin,</hi> is the proper work of the Spirit of God. And how doth that appear? Briefly I ſhall give you two or three Demonſtrations of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It appears <hi>from the oppoſition that is in every carnal heart to be convinced of Sin.</hi> There is a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate oppoſition in our hearts naturally, we are utterly averſe and unwilling to be convinced of <hi>Sin:</hi> We are loth to come to the Light as Chriſt
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:40096:63"/> tells us, <hi>John</hi> 3.20. <hi>Every one that doth evil hateth the Light, neither cometh to the Light leaſt his deeds ſhould be reproved,</hi> leſt he ſhould be convinced; It is the ſame word with this in the Text: He is loath to be convinced of ſin, it is the natural frame of our hearts to be averſe and oppoſite to convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin; therefore there muſt come a ſtronger power, the power of the Spirit, to this work of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing of ſin, elſe we ſhall never be convinced; for, I pray mark, what this convincing of ſin is; For a ſoul to yield to the convictions of ſin, is to yield to its own ſentence of condemnation; and do you think that any one is ready to yield to the ſentence of its own condemnation? Now if a ſoul yield to the conviction of ſin, he yields to the ſentence of condemnation, <hi>For the ſoul that ſinneth, ſhall dye:</hi> And if a ſoul yield that he is guilty of this or that ſin, now he yields to the ſentence of Death and Damnation; And do you think the ſoul will yield to the ſentence of Condemnation paſſed againſt it ſelf? You ſee ſometimes a Malefactor at the Bar, Is he willing, think you, to be convinced of his crime which he is accuſed of? No, he will ſtand out againſt it and deny it as long as he can, and if he cannot deny it, he will mince it, and will not yield to the conviction ſo long as he can poſſibly hold out againſt it, and this is the guiſe of our hearts naturally, not to yield to conviction, but we will hold out againſt it as long as ever we can, let any man come to us to convince us, and reprove us, we will hold againſt it, and ſhift it off, and mince it, and avoid it all that ever we can; this is natural to us, as it was with our firſt Parents, when God called them to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40096:64"/> an account for their firſt ſin, they ſhifted it off; <hi>Adam</hi> to his Wife, his Wife to the Serpent, and would not willingly be convinced; Juſt, as (I told you, before) it was with <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. When <hi>Saul</hi> had diſobeyed the Commandment of the Lord in going againſt <hi>Amalek,</hi> God gave him a ſevere charge to cut off all, Men, Women, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and Cattel; Well, he cuts off the generality of the People, but he ſpared <hi>Agag,</hi> and he ſpared the beſt of the Cattel; Well, <hi>Samuel</hi> comes to him afterward, and <hi>Saul</hi> he comes boaſting, ſaith he, <hi>Come thou bleſſed of the Lord, I have fulfilled the Commandment of the Lord:</hi> haſt thou fulfilled the Commandment of the Lord, ſaith <hi>Samuel? What meaneth then the bleating of the Sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the Oxen?</hi> well, he would not be convinced, ſaith he, 'Tis true, ſome of them are ſaved alive for ſacrifice for the Lord; he would not yield to the Conviction, until ſuch time as <hi>Samuel</hi> was fain to fall downright upon him, and then he fell down under the Conviction, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed and acknowledged his Sin; Thus it is, we are naturally averſe to yield to the convictions of Sin. I pray, mind what I ſay, take a notorious Sinner, one that is commonly known to be guilty of groſs ſins, ſuppoſe drunkenneſs, or uncleanneſs. Come to this man and tell him, The Word of the Lord ſaith expreſly, <hi>That no unrighteous perſon, that no unclean perſon, no drunkard ſhall enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Can he deny the Scripture? No, he cannot deny it; well, but then come and tell him, you are guilty of drunkenneſs, you are guilty of uncleanneſs; and therefore the concluſion is this, it will naturally follow from theſe two
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:40096:64"/> premiſes, <hi>That you ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</hi> Will he yield to the Conviction? No, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Spirit of God come and make him yield to it, he will never yield. Therefore I ſay, from that natural oppoſition that is in all our hearts againſt this work of Conviction, it is therefore required that the power of the Spirit be put forth upon the Soul, ſo Chriſt promiſeth here; I <hi>will ſend the Comforter, and he ſhall convince the World of Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is not only a natural averſeneſs and oppoſition againſt it, in our carnal hearts, but <hi>Satan alſo, the Devil, he will help the Soul to hold out againſt the Conviction of ſin as long as he can,</hi> he will keep the Soul from yielding to it, for the Devil knows this, that when once a Soul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of ſin by the Spirit of God, he is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to loſe that Soul, he is in danger that that Soul will make an eſcape; therefore he lays about him, and doth all that ever he can, to keep the Soul from yielding to be convinced of ſin; juſt like a Jaylor, if he hath a priſoner, whom he perceives hath a mind to make an eſcape, he will lay the more Irons upon him, and have the greater watch and guard about him; ſo in this caſe, if the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſee a Soul in danger to make an eſcape he will clap on all the power he can, to keep the Soul from being convinced of Sin; or like a Governor of a Town, if the Town be beſieged, and he perceive where the Enemy is like to make an Inroad, a Breach, to be ſure he will fortify that place; thus the Devil doth when he diſcerns a Soul is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to make an eſcape, to be delivered from his power, then his deſign is to fortify and ſtrengthen
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:40096:65"/> all that ever he can the Soul, againſt yielding to any work of Conviction, and therefore we read, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. of ſtrong holds, fortifications, ſtrong reaſonings; ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>The Weapons of our Warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds.</hi> There are ſtrong holds, and fortifications, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil doth make round about the Soul, that the Soul ſhould not be able to make an eſcape, except there come a ſtronger than he; for the Devil is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to <hi>a ſtrong man armed,</hi> and except a ſtronger than he come, he will keep poſſeſſion; Now then there muſt come a ſtronger than the Devil, and this is nothing leſs than the Spirit of God. The power of the Spirit comes, and makes conviction to take place on the heart, for the Devil will fortify and ſtrengthen all that ever he can, with reaſons; as for your ſins, when the Soul comes to be troubled at ſin, Why? you are none of the greateſt ſinners, there are hundreds, and thouſands, greater ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners than you are, and God is merciful, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to ſinners, and God will pardon ſinners that do repent, and, <hi>at what time ſoever a ſinner doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent</hi> — And ſuch kind of things as theſe are, whereby he ſtrengthens the Soul againſt yielding to Convictions of ſin; and now the power and policy of the Devil is beyond any ordinary created power, therefore there muſt be a ſtronger power than is in the World that muſt be able really and truly to convince the Soul, of Sin, and that can be no leſs than the power of the Spirit of God, and this is the ſecond Demonſtration of it, why it muſt be the Work of the Spirit to convince the Soul of ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>Truly Brethren, that the evil Spirit, that the Devil may trouble a Soul about Sin, and for Sin, I think it is out of queſtion, by the example of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> that had his Sin ſo ſet home upon him, that he could not live under it; nay, Brethren, the evil Spirit may ſet home ſin upon the hearts of Gods people, and endeavour to overwhelm them: I remember what <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Cap.</hi> 6.4. <hi>The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of the Almighty are within me, and the poyſon thereof drinketh up my Spirit, the Terrors of God ſet themſelves in array againſt me.</hi>— So <hi>Job</hi> 13.26. <hi>Thou writeſt bitter things againſt me, the terrors of the Almighty are upon me.</hi> Brethren, Do you think now, that this was from the Spirit of God? the Spirit of God, when once it comes to be a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Adoption, it never comes to be the Spirit of Bondage again. So the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>You have not received the Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage again to fear, but the Spirit of Adoption.</hi> — Now 'tis true, <hi>Job</hi> doth aſcribe it to God, yet it may be from Satan, becauſe <hi>Job</hi> did aſcribe all that ever he met withall, to God. Satan was an Inſtrument to raiſe a ſtorm, to blow down the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:40096:66"/> houſe where his Children were, yet ſaith <hi>Job: The Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken away;</hi> he takes notice of the hand of God in it, ſo in this caſe; <hi>The Terrors of the Almighty ſet themſelves in Array againſt me:</hi> This may be from the evil Spirit which did become a Spirit of Bondage to him.</p>

                  <head>Queſtion.</head>
                  <p>But you will ſay then, <hi>How ſhall we know when Sin is ſet home upon the Soul, whether it be from the evil Spirit, or from the holy Spirit of God?</hi> This is a Queſtion of very great concernment, I ſhall therefore deſire (through the Lords aſſiſtance) to ſpeak ſomething that way, and to offer ſome things to your conſideration about it, <hi>How you ſhall know when Sin is ſet home upon the heart, Whether it be from the evil Spirit, or from the holy Spirit of God;</hi> for indeed if it be from the Spirit of God, it is in order to Converſion and Salvation, but if by the evil Spirit, it is in order to damnation.</p>

                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>There are ſeveral things that I ſhall offer to your conſideration about this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The evil Spirit,</hi> when he comes and brings ſin, and ſets it before the ſoul, commonly, he doth it in a tumultuous way, he doth it in a confuſed manner, to put the ſoul into a hurry, that poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the ſoul ſhall be mightily troubled about ſin, and cry out, O, I am a damned Creature, and I ſhall be damned in Hell for my ſins, and the wrath of God will abide upon me for ever for my ſins, and yet poſſibly, the ſoul doth not know what particular ſin it is; if you come to particulars, and ask how you are guilty of this or that particular
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:40096:66"/> ſin? O yes, they are ſinners, and they are guilty before God, but come to any particular ſin the ſoul will not fix there, but go from one to another, and ſtill the Devil keeps the Soul in a hurry and confuſion, that one that hears him ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, cannot tell what to make of his condition. O I ſhall be damned for ever for my ſins, and the wrath of God will abide upon me for ever, and yet not convinced by the Spirit of God. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil doth what he can to overwhelm the Soul, as it was the caſe of Saul, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.5. <hi>Sauls heart did tremble,</hi> he was put into an amazing frame, he was afraid, and his heart greatly trembled, and afterward, at the 15th <hi>Verſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am ſorely diſtreſſed, the Philiſtims make war againſt me, and God is departed from me. I am ſorely diſtreſſed.</hi> Why? what was the matter? he could not tell very well what the matter was, but the Devil had troubled his ſpirit, had afflicted him, he was put into a ſore affright, an amaze, and trembling, and he knew not what the matter was, but God had caſt him off, and forſaken him, and now he muſt lie under the wrath of God for ever. Now the Devil to help him forward in his deſpair, at the 18th and 19th <hi>Verſes,</hi> he claps one ſin upon him, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou obeyedſt not the voice of the Lord, nor exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutedſt his fierce wrath upon Amalek, therefore hath the Lord done this thing unto thee.</hi> And ſaith the Devil to him, <hi>The Lord ſhall deliver you into the hands of the Philiſtims, and to morrow ſhall thou and thy Sons be with me.</hi> And thus the Devil claps upon him to confound him, and 'tis ſaid <hi>Verſe</hi> 2. <hi>Then Saul fell ſtraightway all along upon the earth and was ſore afraid;</hi> his heart died in him like a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:40096:67"/> ſtone, thus the trouble upon his Spirit, being from Satan, it was in a kind of hurry and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that one could not tell what to make of his condition, but now on the other ſide, when the Spirit of God comes to convince a Soul of ſin, it ſets ſin in order before the Soul, firſt one thing and then another, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.11. <hi>I will reprove thee and ſet thy ſins in order before thy face;</hi> in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly way, not in a hurry to confound and diſtract a ſoul, but I will ſet them in order before thee, and ſo you may obſerve thoſe that have been convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of their ſins, their ſins have been ſet in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly way before them, in the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.9, 10. When <hi>Nathan</hi> came to convince <hi>David</hi> of his ſins, he ſet his ſins in order before him, firſt one ſin, and then another ſin, and ſo you may obſerve in the Goſpel that thoſe that have been convinced of ſin, the Spirit hath been an orderly Spirit, and hath ſet ſin in order before them. So that, that is one thing, whereby you may know the difference between the trouble for ſin that comes from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſpirit, and the convincing of ſin that comes from the holy Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Take another thing whereby you may ſee the difference, and that is in the End or Deſign that Satan aims at in his troubling a Soul about Sin; What is the Deſign? <hi>The great deſign of the Devil is to bring the Soul into deſpair,</hi> into a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate caſe, and ſo at laſt to make away it ſelf, to diſpatch it ſelf, that is the great end that Satan drives at in his troubling a ſoul about ſin, and with ſin, to drive the ſoul into deſpair, to overwhelm the Soul, and cauſe the Soul, if it be poſſible, to make an end of it ſelf; that is the deſign of Satan,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40096:67"/> he will ſo ſet Sin before the Soul, that it is ſo great that there is no hope it ſhould be pardoned; when he tempts a Soul to ſin, he makes but a litte mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it, it is but a ſmall matt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r, and it is but once, but when the ſoul hath once committed it, then his great deſign is to overwhelm the Soul, and to ſet the ſin before the ſoul, in ſuch a manner, that it looks like the unpardonable Sin. Well, Your ſin is now unpardonable, and there is no hope for you; and many times he makes ſouls believe that they have ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and now there is no hope for them: Juſt as it was with <hi>Cain. Gen.</hi> 4.11. Oh, ſaith he, <hi>My ſin is greater than can be forgiven.</hi> This now is the deſign of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, to cauſe a Soul, if poſſible, to make a way it ſelf; you ſee how the Devil carried it towards <hi>Judas: Judas</hi> had committed a very great ſin in betraying the Son of God; Well, when he had ſinned, the Devils deſign was now ſo to ſet home his ſin upon him that he could find no reſt day nor night, till ſuch time as he had gone and hanged himſelf. It is the great end that Satan aims at in his troubling a Soul about ſin; his great deſign is to bring the ſoul into deſpair, and ſo to make away it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Whereas now on the other hand, the great end of the Spirit of God is to make a ſoul ſenſible of ſin, ſo as to be humbled for it, ſo as to repent of it; 'Tis true indeed, ſometimes when ſin is ſet home by the Spirit of God upon a Soul, the Soul may be brought very low, may be much over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, and may poſſibly be brought into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing, deſponding condition, and may be ready ſometimes to make a way it ſelf, to deſtroy it ſelf, by the Devils ſetting in with it; yet ordinarily
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40096:68"/> the Spirit of God comes and prevents ſuch things, where the conviction begins from the Spirit, the holy Spirit doth prevent ſuch things, the Soul is made to look up to God, as <hi>Jonah</hi> did, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.4. <hi>I ſaid, I was caſt out of thy ſight, the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected me: Yet,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>will I look towards thy holy Temple.</hi> The Spirit of God had convinced him of his ſin, and though he did ſeem to be caſt out of God's ſight out of his favour, and was thrown into the belly of the Whale, yet the Spirit of the Lord would not ſuffer him to be deſpondent and give over all as deſperate; <hi>Yet will I look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thy Holy Temple.</hi> That is the ſecond thing whereby we may diſcern the difference.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>When the evil Spirit doth ſet home a ſin upon the Soul, it is to drive the Soul further from God.</hi> When the Holy Ghoſt comes to convince a Soul of ſin, it is to draw the Soul nearer to God. You may obſerve it, that when ever the Devil doth ſet home a ſin upon the Soul, it is to drive the Soul further off from God. Take an Inſtance or two; as in the Example of our firſt Parents, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. The Devil had been buſie with our firſt Parents, to bring them into ſin, to make them eat of the forbidden fruit; Well, when they had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſin, though before he had told them it was for their profit and advantage, <hi>Their Eyes ſhould be opened, and they ſhould be as gods,</hi>— Yet when once they had committed the ſin, he ſets it ſo home up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, that they fled from the preſence of God, <hi>and hid themſelves;</hi> they durſt not appear before God, they went and hid themſelves amongſt the Trees of the Garden, that God was fain to call af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them. And ſo you ſhall find in the example of
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40096:68"/> 
                     <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>Cain,</hi> when he had committed the ſin of murder, and had killed his brother <hi>Abel, Verſe</hi> 16. it is ſaid there, <hi>That Cain went out from the preſence of the Lord;</hi> he departed from God, then he went away from God; But how could that be? Is not God preſent every where? how could <hi>Cain</hi> go out from the preſence of the Lord? Why, he did not go from the eſſential preſence of God, but from the preſence of God, that is, from the ſpiritual preſence of God in his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he did not now draw near to God in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but he went away from God, from the Church, from the Ordinances, from the Means of Communion with God, for the Ordinances of God: the Church of God, was in the houſe of his Father <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo they worſhipped God in that family, but he went out from the preſence of the Lord when he had committed that ſin; this is the deſign of Satan, when he can overwhelm the ſoul with ſin, his great end is, as to bring it to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, ſo alſo to drive it further from the preſence of God. But now you may obſerve, when the Spirit of God doth convince a ſoul of ſin, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction doth cauſe a ſoul to draw near to God in holy duties, in holy Ordinances, and to draw near to God for mercy and grace through Chriſt: ſo ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.6.7 He was under a great trouble in his Conſcience and Mind about ſin, and he falls a pleading with God; <hi>Will the Lord caſt off for ever,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Will he be gracious no more?</hi> and thus he falls on arguing and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I will remember,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the years of the right hand of the Moſt High,</hi> and ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 88. there you have a ſad <hi>Pſalm,</hi> A ſoul that was mightily
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:40096:69"/> oppreſſed under the burthen of ſin, and there he pleads <hi>Verſe</hi> 10. ſaith he, <hi>Lord, what good will my Life do thee, if thou ſhouldſt cut off my days? ſhall the dead praiſe thee?</hi> And ſo he goes on, pleading and arguing ſtrongly with God, and ſo in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Jona, Chap.</hi> 2.4, 7: <hi>I ſaid I was caſt out of thy Sight, yet will I look towards thy holy Temple. When my ſoul fainted within me, I remembred the the Lord, and my prayer came in unto thee towards thy holy Temple.</hi> He was ſo far from running away from God, when his ſin was ſet home upon him, that now he draws near to God, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf, and ſought the Lord, <hi>And my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er came in unto thee into thy holy Temple.</hi> That is a third differenee between the trouble that ariſes for ſin from the evil Spirit, and the trouble that ariſes in a ſoul, that is convinced by the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Commonly, <hi>When Sin is ſet home by the evil Spirit,</hi> and a Soul comes to be troubled for ſin by the means of the Devil, <hi>commonly you will find that that Soul will be ready to riſe up againſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Inſtruments that are the means of his conviction:</hi> The Soul will riſe up with indignation, againſt the very Inſtruments that are the means to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince it of ſin: I might give you many Inſtances for this, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.33. at the 30th <hi>verſe, Peter</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to convince the <hi>Jews</hi> of their ſin in murdering of Chriſt, <hi>The God of our Fathers rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up Jeſus, whom ye ſlew, and hanged on a Tree;</hi> and mark, <hi>verſe</hi> 33. What was the event of it? How did this work upon their hearts? Their hearts did riſe up with indignation againſt <hi>Peter,</hi> and the reſt of the Diſciples, that went about to
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:40096:69"/> convince them of their ſin. <hi>When they heard that they were cut to the heart, and took counſel to ſlay them.</hi> They could not bear it, if it had been from the Spirit of God they could not have took it ſo. <hi>They were cut to the heart, and took counſel to ſlay them.</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51, 52, 54. It is ſaid there, When <hi>Stephen</hi> went about to convince the <hi>Jews</hi> of that horrible ſin of ſlaying the Prophets; <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked and uncircumciſed in heart and eare, ye do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt. Which of the Prophets have not your Fathers perſecuted?</hi> — He ſet home their ſin upon them, and how did they take it? <hi>verſe</hi> 54. <hi>When they heard theſe things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnaſhed on him with their teeth.</hi> So far were they from falling down, and yielding to the Conviction, that their Spirits do riſe up with indignation againſt the inſtrument that went about to convince them of their ſin. You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the ſtory concerning <hi>Ahab;</hi> he had diverſe Prophets that would not let him alone, but would be telling him of his ſin, and convincing him of his ſin; The Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> would be reproving him of his ſin; and how did his heart riſe up in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt <hi>Elijah;</hi> and when he met with him, he gave him ſuch a gratulation as this, <hi>Haſt thou found me, O mine enemy?</hi> and, <hi>Art thou he that troubleſt Iſrael?</hi> He could not endure to bear the Prophet <hi>Elijah,</hi> becauſe he troubled his Spirit by convincing him of ſin; he called him, <hi>The troubler of the Land;</hi> And, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. You read of <hi>Micaiah,</hi> a Prophet of the Lord, and he had been very bold and plain with <hi>Ahab,</hi> and told him of his ſins; well, when they there were in an exigency and ſtrait, King <hi>Ahab,</hi> and King
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:40096:70"/> 
                     <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> was to go together to Battel to <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth Gilead, ver.</hi> 4. and 5. and <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> would have the Prophets called together, that they might adviſe and conſult with them, whether they ſhould go to <hi>Ramoth-Gilead,</hi> or no; At the 6th <hi>verſe,</hi> You read there, that <hi>Ahab</hi> would call four hundred Prophets together, before he would call <hi>Micaiah,</hi> but ſaith <hi>Jehoſhaphat, verſe</hi> 7. <hi>Is there not here a Prophet of the Lord beſides; that we might enquire of him? Yes, ſaith Ahab, there is one Micaiah, but I hate him,</hi> why? ſaith he, <hi>He never ſpake con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> He was always grating upon his Sins, to convince him of his ſins, and now his heart riſes againſt him; this is the guiſe of the Soul, that is not convinced by the Spirit of God, the heart will riſe up againſt the Inſtrument and Means that endeavor to convince them of ſin. Whereas now on the other ſide, where the holy Spirit of God cometh to convince a Soul of ſin, you will find the contrary; the Soul will be ready to cloſe with the very Inſtrument and Means that doth convince him of ſin, it will embrace and love the inſtrument, you may ſee it, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. When <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> and the Apoſtles dealt plainly with the people, at the 22 <hi>verſe,</hi> ſay they, <hi>Ye men of Iſrael hear theſe Words.</hi> v. 23. <hi>Him, being delivered by the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Counſel and Foreknowledge of God, ye have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and by wicked hands have crucified and ſlain.</hi> Say they, <hi>Ye have killed the Son of God;</hi> There was plain dealing, and ſo afterwards, and ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, he tells them again, <hi>verſe</hi> 36. <hi>Therefore let all the houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made that ſame Jeſus, whom ye have crucified both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> Well, how did they bear
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:40096:70"/> this at their hands? <hi>v.</hi> 37. <hi>Now, when they heard this they were pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ked at their hearts, and they ſaid unto Peter, and to the reſt of the Apoſtles, Men and Brethren, What ſhall we do? Men and Brethren,</hi> not <hi>Enemies,</hi> no, but <hi>Brethren</hi> now; Ay, when the Spirit of God convinces a ſoul of ſin, by any Inſtruments, it will look at the inſtruments ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Brethren, than as haters of them; they will look upon them in another manner, and give them other manner of Appellations and Greetings, <hi>Men and Brethren.</hi> And truly Brethren, this is a good ſign that the Holy Ghoſt hath been at work upon the heart, in a way of conviction, when as the ſoul is ready to cloſe with thoſe that are the Means and Inſtruments of convincing them of ſin.</p>
                  <p>That is the fourth thing whereby we may come to diſcern the difference between the trouble for ſin, that comes from the evil Spirit, and that trouble that comes from the holy Spirit, in a way of convincing of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>When Trouble for ſin doth come from the evil Spirit, ordinarily the heart will be ready to murmur againſt God himſelf,</hi> ſecretly murmur againſt God himſelf, and think that God dealeth very hardly with ſinners, and very rigidly to lay ſuch heavy puniſhments upon ſinners for ſmall matters. (as they are ready to think): What? afflict us here? lay ſuch heavy puniſhments upon us here, for a ſmall ſin? and then inflict eternal death too, and let the wrath of God ly upon the ſoul for ever for ſin; God deals very hardly for ſin, the heart ſecretly riſes againſt God, and murmurs againſt God for it; as if God were unrighteous and dealt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40096:71"/> very rigidly and ſeverely, as <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4. ſaith he, <hi>My Puniſhment is greater than I can bear,</hi> 'tis too great a puniſhment. And, I remember, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.25. The Lord complains of the people, that they were ready to murmur againſt him, as if his ways were not equal. <hi>The Fathers have eaten ſowre grapes, and the Childrens teeth we ſet on edge;</hi> We are puniſhed, ſay they, for our Fathers ſins; God deals unrighteouſly with us, and unequally with us; that God is fain to clear himſelf; <hi>I tell you,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>the Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall dy.</hi> And, <hi>the Child ſhall not bear the puniſhment of his Fathers:</hi> So they were ready to judge hardly of God, as if God were unrighteous. And ſo I remember, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.10, 11. <hi>And the fifth Angel powred out his Vial upon the ſeat of the Beaſt, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was full of Darkneſs, and they gnawed their tongues for pain.</hi> And what then? <hi>v.</hi> 11. <hi>And they blaſphemed the God of Heaven becauſe of their pain, and their ſoares, and repented not of their Deeds.</hi> When God comes to lay afflictions upon a ſoul, and ſin is ſet home by the Devil, they will be ready to blaſpheme God, at leaſt ſecretly in their hearts, that God is a hard God, and deals very rigidly and ſeverely; what, for a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er, to lay ſuch heavy puniſhments upon us here, and eternal wrath for ever? the Lord dealeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſly. Whereas now on the other ſide, when a ſoul is convinced of ſin, by the holy Spirit of God, the Soul is ready to juſtify God, though he do afflict: As I remember, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.14. ſaith <hi>Ezra</hi> there, <hi>And whatever is come upon us for our evil Deeds, our God hath puniſhed us leſs than our iniquities have deſerved.</hi> God might have laid
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:40096:71"/> much more upon us. So <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.33. <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> and the reſt there do acknowledge that the Lord was righteous in all that was come upon them. <hi>Howbeit thou art juſt in all that is brought upon us, for thou haſt done right</hi> —. So I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>David,</hi> when God had convinced him of his ſin of Murder and Adultery, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. he makes that as his penitential <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and ſaith he, <hi>Verſe</hi> 4. <hi>That thou mighteſt be juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt, and clear when thou judgeſt.</hi> Lord, ſaith he, I will clear thee whatever cometh of me; this is the guiſe and frame of a ſoul, that is convinced of ſin by the Spirit of God; ſuch a Soul will juſtify God, and acknowledge that God is holy and righteous in all his dealings. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.2, 3. There <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> complains, that God had ſhut out his prayer; <hi>I cry night and day,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but thou regardeſt not, but yet,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>thou art holy, thou art righteous ſtill.</hi> Thus it is with a ſoul that is convinced by the holy Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. You ſhall find another difference, <hi>When the evil ſpirit convinces a Soul of Sin, and troubles the Soul about ſin, you may obſerve there, the Soul is not troubled for ſin as 'tis ſin;</hi> nor is it taken off from ſin as ſin, but only troubled about the effects of it, but is not taken off from ſin, no not from any ſin as 'tis ſin; poſſibly ſuch a Soul may be under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint for a time from his ſin, or poſſibly he will never venture upon that ſin again that his Soul hath been troubled about, and his Conſcience ſo tattered and terrified about, yet is not taken off from all ſin. You know <hi>Judas</hi> was troubled for his ſin, the Devil had drawn him into ſin to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray Chriſt, when he had drawn him into the ſin,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:40096:72"/> then the Devil falls upon his Conſcience, and drives him into deſpair, even to hang himſelf. But it is likely, if he had lived an hundred years after, he would never have done the like crime again, he would never have betrayed his Maſter again; but yet he was not taken off from ſin as ſin; (if a Soul be taken off from ſin a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſin, he will be cut off from all ſin) for you ſee he fell upon ſelf murder for all that, and upon the ſin of deſpair for all that, ſo that I ſay, ſuch a ſoul is not taken off from all ſin.</p>
                  <p>Whereas now a ſoul that is convinced by the Spirit of God, it doth cut him off from all ſin, that now a Soul doth loath and hate every ſin that he knows to be ſin, he will not meddle with it; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. ſaith <hi>David, I hate every falſe way,</hi> And, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.8. <hi>What have I to do any more with Idols?</hi> Never meddle with Idols more. Thus the Soul will be taken off from all ſin, will not venture upon any thing that is ſin. That is the ſixth.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Let me add one more, and that is this; <hi>A ſoul that is under trouble for ſin, from the evil ſpirit, the trouble will in time wear off, and will be removed and healed, by ſome way or other that is not the right way of Cure.</hi> I pray mind it; I ſay ſuch a ſoul, though it may be under a great ſtroak, a great wound for ſin, if Satan do not prevail upon the ſoul to drive it to diſpair, the wound will be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome means or other that is not the right way and means, poſſibly ſometimes it wears away by length of time, it vaniſheth and wears off by length of time, by degrees; Juſt as it is with a Land-Flood, it comes ſometimes with great
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:40096:72"/> ſhowres and ſtorms, but it waſtes away by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees inſenſibly; So in this caſe, you ſhall have ſome ſouls ſometimes ſo afflicted, and oppreſſed, and troubled for ſin, that they cannot reſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor let others reſt with them, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the burthen of their ſins, what burthens they are under, and the burthen wears off by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, their trouble of Conſcience wears off by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: But how? they themſelves know not, nor their friends neither; but had it been from the Spirit of God, it would not have worn off ſo. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> was convinced of the danger he was in by the Prophet, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. The Prophet comes to him and threatens him from the Lord, that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God ſhould fall upon him and his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity <hi>Verſe</hi> 21. <hi>That he would cut off all the Poſterity of Ahab, every one that piſſeth againſt the wall. Ahab</hi> was now convinced and troubled in his mind, and he would fain avoid the judgment, and therefore he humbleth himſelf in ſack-cloth, he was very penitent, inſomuch as the Lord took notice of it, and told the Prophet of it, <hi>verſe</hi> 29. <hi>Seeſt thou how Ahab humbleth himſelf?</hi> So that <hi>Ahab</hi> was under a reſtraint for a time, for about two or three years, that he durſt not go to Battel; But look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the beginning of the next Chapter; and it is ſaid, in the third year, he would venture to go out, when the troubles were a little worn off his ſpirit, then he would venture to go out, and then he was ſlain; So, many a man or woman is under very ſore trouble of Spirit and Conſcience for ſin, and yet notwithſtanding the trouble may wear off again, and that's an argument it was not from the Spirit of God; ſometimes trouble about ſin may wear
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:40096:73"/> away, it may be diverted by the multiplicity of worldly buſineſs, he may thruſt himſelf over head and years in the buſineſs of the world, and ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly may calm and quiet his Conſcience for the preſent, and if it be not from the Spirit of God poſſibly it will never return again. You read of <hi>Cain, Gen.</hi> 4.17. He was troubled in his ſpirit about his ſin, and he went about the matters of the world, about marrying of Wives, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a City, and by that means wore away his trouble, you hear no more of him. Sometimes trouble is worn off by merry Company, chearly Company, and by Muſick, and the like, and ſo drive away their ſad and melancholy humours; juſt as it was with <hi>Saul:</hi> We read of <hi>Saul</hi> when the evil Spirit was upon him, he would call for one to play upon an Inſtrument of Muſick to drive away the evil ſpirit; Ay, the trouble was from an evil ſpirit indeed, and now therefore it muſt be driven away by a fit of Muſick. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times again you may be free from this trouble of ſpirit about ſin, by making reſtitution and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Oh they have wronged ſuch and ſuch, and this bears them down and oppreſſes them, the very thoughts of it, and they know not what to do. Well, they will go and make reſtitution and ſatisfaction, and ſo lick themſelves whole, the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is over. And ſo ſometimes they will eaſe themſelves of their trouble by performance of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and by the reformation of their Lives. We read of <hi>Herod,</hi> he was convinced of his ſin of <hi>Inceſt</hi> in marrying of his Brothers Wife. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> convinced him of it, and told him it was not lawful for him to have his Brothers Wife; and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:40096:73"/> thereupon he goes to hear <hi>John</hi> preach, and 'tis ſaid, he reformed many things; he ſet upon a work of reformation, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.12. <hi>He heard John Baptiſt gladly, and did many things,</hi> &amp;c. And there was an end of his trouble. Now I ſay, this is that I bring it for, to ſhew you that trouble about ſin, that comes from the evil ſpirit, commonly it is healed and cured by ſuch means, as are not the right means for the cure; whereas now, a Soul that is convinced by the Spirit of God, will never be cured but by the ſame hand that wounded it; it will never be cured but by the right plaiſter, the right <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>alve; without the blood of Chriſt, and the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, applyed by Faith, the Soul will never be cured.</p>
                  <p>I remember a Story of Mr. <hi>Bilney,</hi> that was burnt here at <hi>Lollards Pit,</hi> without <hi>Biſhops Gate,</hi> he tells a ſtory of himſelf, and Mr. <hi>Latimer;</hi> this Mr. <hi>Latimer</hi> was a young man, a man of very pregnant parts, but he was a Papiſt. Now Mr. <hi>Bilney</hi> thought to circumvent Mr. <hi>Latimer,</hi> and to gain him by a wile, and ſo he goes to Mr. <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer,</hi> pretending himſelf a Papiſt, he would make Mr. <hi>Latimer</hi> his Confeſſor, ſo he goes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes himſelf to him, and there he tells him how he had been troubled in mind about his ſin, and ſo troubled, ſaith he, that I could find no reſt nor peace, till I came to the right cure: I was ſet ſaith he, to go a Pilgrimage to ſuch a place, but my trouble continued, and I was ſet to do ſuch a Pennance, and my trouble ſtill continued, till ſuch time as I read in the new Teſtament, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt came into the World to ſave ſinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereof I am chief;</hi> and ſaith he, when that was
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:40096:74"/> ſet home upon me, then I was quiet and free from my trouble; Truly ſo it will be, a ſoul will never come to a right cure, till ſuch time as it comes to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and the vertue of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, applyed to the ſoul by Faith, the ſoul will never come to any true peace or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. And thus now you have ſeen ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between the trouble of a ſoul about ſin, that comes from the evil ſpirit, and the convincing of a ſoul by the holy Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>So now I have done with the third thing, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That it is the proper Work of the Spirit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a Soul of ſin, in order to Converſion.</hi> There is one thing more remaining, and I ſhall briefly draw to an end.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And that is to ſhew you, That as Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of ſin is the work of the Spirit, ſo alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>It is the firſt work of the Spirit, in order to Converſion and Salvation:</hi> for ſo the Point was laid down, That it is the firſt work of the Spirit, in order to Converſion and Salvation, to convince a Soul of ſin. Now how doth that appear? Briefly in two or three Words.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thus, becauſe, <hi>The Lord in the Work of the new Creation, doth ordinarily uſe the ſame Method that he did in the old Creation. You know in the firſt Creation of the World, the firſt particular Work that God wrought was Light,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Let there be Light and there was Light.</hi> Light is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by things are diſcovered, light makes things ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt; So now God comes in the new Creation, when he is about the great Work of the new Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation upon the Soul, the firſt thing God works in the ſoul is to create Light, Light whereby the ſoul
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40096:74"/> may come to ſee and diſcern what is in himſelf, he comes to ſee and diſcern ſin, ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God, that commanded Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath ſhined into our hearts;</hi> In the new Creation he doth cauſe a ſoul to ſee and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern its own unrighteouſneſs, and there where true righteouſneſs is to be had, the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt (of which we may ſpeak after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, if the Lord pleaſe). He ſhall firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the World of ſin, and then of righteouſneſs; but the firſt Work is to create Light in the ſoul, and ſuch Light as to diſcover ſin; as Chriſt told <hi>Paul,</hi> when he called him to preach the Goſpel, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. ſaith he, <hi>I have ſent thee to turn people from Darkneſs to Light.</hi> That is the firſt Work commonly the Spirit doth, in order to Converſion and Salvation, to bring in a light into the ſoul to diſcover ſin; the ſoul was in darkneſs before, and ſaw no great evil in ſin, but now there is a light brought in, whereby the ſoul is made to ſee and diſcern ſin, and ſo is convinced of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is the firſt Work of the Spirit in order to Converſion, to convince the ſoul of ſin, becauſe, <hi>Till a Soul be convinced of ſin, it will never much heed the Goſpel of Grace.</hi> Alas! the Goſpel, and the glorious Grace that is held forth in the Goſpel, is a very ſlighty thing to a carnal heart, they make a light matter of it, they do even mock at it, as a very ſimple fooliſh thing; as in <hi>Acts</hi> 17. When <hi>Paul</hi> was Preaching to the <hi>Athenians,</hi> ſay they, <hi>What will this Babler ſay? v.</hi> 18. It is but a kind of babling. So ſometimes, ſome of your learned Doctors have counted the preaching of the Goſpel but prating and babling, ſo <hi>v.</hi> 22. <hi>When they heard

                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:40096:75"/> the reſurrection of the dead, ſome mocked</hi> —. They made a ſlight matter of it, and diſregarded it; but now, when a ſoul comes to be convinced of ſin, then it will be ready to attend the Goſpel, the ſoul will then be ready to hear what God ſpeaks in the Goſpel. See that example again, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. You read there, thoſe that were converted by <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, at firſt they did not regard what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſaid; ſay they, <hi>Theſe men are drunken with new wine, and they talk they know not what;</hi> but afterward, they came to be of another mind, when <hi>Peter</hi> had preached to them, and the Spirit had gone along with him to convince them of ſin, then, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> now we will hearken to you, and hear any thing you will ſay to us: I ſay, upon this account, it is the firſt work of the Spirit to convince the ſoul of ſin, becauſe the ſoul makes but a ſlight matter of the grace of God in the Goſpel, till it be convinced of ſin, it will make but a mocking matter of it: But when a ſoul comes to be convinced of ſin, by the holy Spirit of God, then the Word of the Lord will be precious to him, and then we will hear thy Words for they are ſweet.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And laſtly, The Spirit doth firſt convince the ſoul of ſin, in order to Converſion and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Becauſe till ſuch time as a Soul be convinced of ſin, the Soul is not fit to be married to Chriſt;</hi> There muſt be firſt a Divorce, before there can be another marriage; if a woman be to be married the ſecond time, ſhe muſt not marry whileſt her Husband lives without a Divorce, ſo 'tis in this caſe, a Soul cannot truly be married to Chriſt till ſuch time as it be dead to the law of ſin. The
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40096:75"/> Apoſtle ſpeaks very elegantly to this purpoſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.1, 2. <hi>Know you not Brethren: I ſpeak to them that know the Law; how the Law hath Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over a man ſo long as he liveth;</hi> And ſo on. And at the 4 <hi>v.</hi> he comes to make Application, <hi>Wherefore, my Brethren, ye alſo are become dead to the Law by the body of Chriſt, that ye ſhould be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to another, even to him that was raiſed from the dead.</hi> You cannot be marryed to Chriſt, till ſuch time as you be clear from your firſt Husband, and how come we to be divorced from the Law of ſin, but by conviction of ſin; when the Spirit of the Lord comes to convince of ſin, then there is a Divorce, then the heart is taken off from ſin. Indeed (as I told you before) if the ſoul be not convinced by the Spirit, he is not convinced of ſin as ſin, but when the Spirit of the Lord comes and convinces a Soul of ſin, here is a Divorce, and now the Soul is made fit to marry with Chriſt. And ſo you have ſeen the Point o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>

               <div type="application">
                  <head>Application.</head>
                  <p>Now one word or two by way of Application, and I have done.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then, <hi>Hereby we may come to diſcern, or have a near ſcantling about our ſpiritual Eſtate, whether we have had the Work of Converſion wrought in us or no.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſpeak but a Word to it, and leave it to your further Conſideration. Conſider whether the firſt ſtep towards Converſion hath ever been ſet; that is, the Work of Conviction by the Spirit. Hath the Lord by his Spirit ever convinced you of ſin? hath the Spirit come and brought ſin unto
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40096:76"/> you, and ſet it home upon you? hath the Spirit of the Lord ſo ſet home ſin upon you, that you have not been able to make any evaſion? for that (as you heard) is the nature of true Conviction; and hath the Spirit ſo ſet home ſin upon you that your heart came to be affected with it, and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, that you are made to humble your ſelves before the Lord under the ſenſe of ſin? Well, have your ſouls ever been thus convinced of ſin or no? if not, then you have not ſet the firſt ſtep towards Converſion. I pray mind it.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, yes, I hope I have been convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of ſin, I have had ſome ſins ſo ſet home upon me, that I could not deny it, nor avoid it, but my heart hath been greatly afflicted under it, that I could not reſt day nor night, and I have been afraid I ſhould have ſunk into the bottomleſs pit.</p>
                  <p>But I pray conſider, was this Conviction from the holy Spirit of God? you have heard there may be a trouble for ſin, that may come from the evil ſpirit. What was it any other but the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that may come from the evil ſpirit? yes, you will ſay, I hope it is from the holy Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>For that, you may conſider thoſe ſeven things, that were laid down to diſcover when ſin is ſet home by the holy Spirit of God, you may conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of them at your leiſure, when you are in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate between the Lord, and your own Souls. But let me only propound this one thing to you from them all, you ſay, you have been convinc'd of ſin by the Spirit of God, I pray mind it, for it is that that doth concern our everlaſting ſtate, our eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, for if the firſt ſtep be not ſet toward our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:40096:76"/> then we cannot expect that the other ſteps are ſet, therefore I ſay, you that ſay, you hope you have been convinced of ſin by the Spirit, I pray conſider, how was your Conviction healed? how was your trouble taken off? Conſider of it between the Lord and your own Souls, you were troubled for your ſins once, but how is it taken off? did it wither away by degrees, like a land-flood, that makes a great noiſe for a time, but wears away by degrees inſenſibly? Was it ſo with you? or was your trouble taken off by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king reſtitution, giving of ſatisfaction where you have wronged? or was it by reformation and performance of duties, and ſo obtained the life by your own hands (as the Prophets expreſſion is) or was it by making application of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt to your Souls, in a way of faith and believing? Were you brought to that? Truly, if not, I cannot ſay, but that your Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin might be from the evil ſpirit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conſider ſeriouſly of it, hereby we may come in ſome meaſure to diſcern about our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Eſtate, whether the work of Converſion be effectually wrought or no: Conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this firſt ſtep be ſet, namely, Convincing of ſin by the Spirit of God, and truly, if ſo be the holy Spirit have convinced you of Sin, I am apt to think, that the Spirit will never leave till it hath made thorow Work; ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1.6. <hi>We are confident of this very thing, that he that hath begun a good Work in you, will certainly finiſh it to the Day of Chriſt.</hi> And if the holy Spirit hath begun to convince you of ſin the Spirit will go on to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40096:77"/> convince you of Righteouſneſs too. That is the firſt Word of Application. I have another and ſo have done.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It is to exhort and perſwade you, that if ever the Work of Conviction ſhould come upon your hearts, and ſpirits, to take heed that you do not hinder it, but further it what you can.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confeſs it is irkſome to fleſh, and blood, our carnal hearts cannot away with this Work of Conviction, but will avoid it, and eſcape it if poſſible. But take heed you do not hinder it, but further it what you can, becauſe elſe, if it be from the holy Spirit of God, you do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Spirit, and go about to quench the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Therefore you ſhould do, even as old <hi>Eli</hi> adviſed young <hi>Samuel,</hi> when the Lord began to call him, ſaith Eli, <hi>When you hear the Voice again, ſay, ſpeak Lord, for thy Servant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth to hear.</hi> So I ſay to you, doth any word come to your Hearts, and ſpeak to your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, in a way of Conviction of ſin, do not drive it away, do not quench it, but ſay, Speak Lord, for thy Servant deſireth to hear. And now plead with the Lord, do not now riſe up in your Spirits againſt the Inſtruments, that are means to convince you, take heed of that, but rather ly low before the Lord, and bleſs the Lord that any Word is ſpoken to you by way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and never leave till ſuch time as you come to reſt upon Chriſt, and his Righteouſneſs, and upon the vertue of his death, whereby he hath made ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of poor ſinners. I ſay, do not neglect, do
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40096:77"/> not ſlight, or deſpiſe, or quench, or check this Work of Conviction.</p>
                  <p>And ſo now I have done with this Point. The next Point is concerning the Spirits convincing of the ſin of unbelief. <hi>He ſhall convince the World of ſin, becauſe they believe not on me.</hi> But thus much ſhall ſuffice for this time.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>That the firſt work of the Spirit of God upon the heart, in order to Converſion, is to convince the Soul of Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt ſaith here, that he would ſend the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit after his departure from them; ſaith he, <hi>I will ſend the Comforter,</hi> and this he ſpake to ſupport and comfort the hearts of his Diſciples againſt his abſence, and therefore the end of his Spirit was to cooperate with their Miniſtry, it was in order to the Converſion of Souls; this is the matter of their comfort. Now this I have ſpoken to at large be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but now to come to the ſecond Note or Point, which doth plainly lye before us, which I ſhall deſire to ſpeak ſomething to at preſent, and that is this.</p>

                     <p>That the great and ſpecial Sin that the Spirit of God doth uſually convince People of in order to their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, is their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, not believing on Chriſt.</p>
                  </body>

               <p>For ſo ſaith Chriſt here, <hi>He ſhall convince the World of Sin.</hi> Of what Sin? He tells them of their Unbelief. <hi>Of Sin, becauſe they believe not on me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is, the great and ſpecial Sin that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is wont to convince people of in order to their Salvation, namely, <hi>their <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief.</hi> It is indeed the work of the Spirit to convince of other ſins, as you heard before, but yet in a ſpecial manner 'tis the work of the Spirit, to convince of this ſin of Unbelief; He is ſaid ſo to convince of this <hi>Sin,</hi> as if there were no other ſins to be convinced off: he mentions no other ſins; <hi>But he ſhall convince the World of ſin, becauſe they believe not on me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this you ſhall find in part verified preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after Chriſts Aſcenſion into Heaven. In a few dayes after Chriſts Aſcenſion into Heaven, he ſent the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. The Holy Ghoſt was poured down abundantly upon the Diſciples when they were met together, thereupon <hi>Peter</hi> preached a ſermon to the People that came wondring about him, and now <hi>Peter</hi> had experience of what Chriſt here promiſed, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I will ſend the Spirit, and he ſhall convince the World of ſin by your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry;</hi> And at <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, there was three thou-convinced at one clap, they were convinced of ſin, not only of their not believing on Chriſt, but of their murdering of Chriſt, that they had Crucified
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40096:79"/> the Lord of Life; and when they heard this, then by the power of the Spirit, that went along with <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, 'tis ſaid, they were pricked at the heart and cryed out, <hi>Men and brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> They ſaw now a need of Chriſt, and were glad now to receive Chriſt, and to believe in Chriſt. Well, for the proſecution of this point, I ſhall deſire briefly to ſpeak to three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Shew you, That not Believing on Chriſt is a ſin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is not only a ſin not to believe in Chriſt, but a great ſin, one of the greateſt ſins that a ſoul can be guilty of.</p>
               <p n="3">3 That it is the work of the Spirit to convince a Soul of the ſin of Unbelief.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, that Unbelief is a ſin: It is that which very few are ſenſible of, they ſcarce look upon unbelief to be a ſin; they look upon belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving rather as their preſumption, and for their not believing, they look upon it rather as their duty, as their humility. Now I ſay, Unbelief is a ſin; Such as do not believe on Chriſt, they are guilty of ſin. But mark, I do not ſay, that every one that doth not believe on Chriſt is guilty of the ſin of Unbelief: No, but Unbelief is a ſin only to them that have the Goſpel preached to them, and Chriſt offered to them; it is a ſin to them not to believe on Chriſt, 'tis not a ſin to others; and though Heathens and Pagans ſhall be condemned and damned in their unbelief, yet not for their not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on Chriſt. Saith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 15.22. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken to them, they had not had ſin,</hi> that is, they had not had the ſin of Unbelief, they had not been guilty of that ſin; <hi>but now they have no Cloak,</hi> no excuſe, <hi>for their ſin.</hi> Look now
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40096:79"/> as it is with thoſe that have not the Law written, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.12, 14, 15. <hi>They that ſin without Law, ſhall be judged without the Law:</hi> They ſhall not be judged and condemned by the written Law, but they ſhall be judged and condemned by the Law that is written in their hearts and conſciences. So now here, thoſe that never had the Goſpel preached to them, as a great many Nations in the World, <hi>Pagans, Heathens,</hi> and <hi>Infidels,</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> they never had the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel preached to them, Chriſt was never reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, the Name of Chriſt never ſounded in their ears, now they ſhall not be condemned for their not believing on Chriſt, 'tis not a ſin to them. And therefore ſome tell us, there is a twofold Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. There is a Negative or Privative Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that is the Unbelief of thoſe that never had the means of Faith offered them, and it is not a ſin for them not to believe on Chriſt, becauſe they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of him. But when there is a Poſitive Unbelief (as they call it) that is, the Unbelief of ſuch as live under the ſound of the Goſpel, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hearing of Chriſt. Chriſt is preached to them, and held forth to them, and they are called upon to believe on Chriſt, and yet they believe not; this is a Poſitive unbelief, and this unbelief is a ſin: And that it is a ſin, let me give you two or three Demonſtrations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It appears to be a ſin, becauſe it is the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Moral Law, or the Law of the Ten Commandments. <hi>Where there is no Law,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>there is no Tranſgreſſion;</hi> Sin is not imputed where there is no Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.13. But ſin is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law, and this ſin of unbelief a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40096:80"/> of the Moral Law, of the firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <div type="objection">
                  <head>Objection.</head>
                  <p>How ſo, you will ſay? Was believing on Chriſt then commanded to <hi>Adam</hi> in the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment?</p>

Now how do we own God? When we give him that worſhip that he requires of us; now the firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment requires that we ſhould worſhip God with a natural worſhip, which is due to God from us as we are his Creatures; that is comprized in the firſt Commandment; You ſhall worſhip God as God; worſhip him, How? Obey him, fear him, love him, reverence him, believe in him, put truſt and confidence in him. The firſt Commandment requires that we ſhould yield obedience to God in whatſoever is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of us; Then this is virtually required in the firſt Commandment. 'Tis our duty by virtue of the firſt Commandment to believe in Chriſt. Now if it be commanded in the Law, then our unbelief is a ſin, becauſe it is a tranſgreſſion of the Law.</p>

                  <p>But you will ſay (a little for the clearing of this) but this was inconſiſtent with the ſtate of
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:40096:80" rendition="simple:additions"/> Innocency, for <hi>Adam</hi> to believe on Chriſt as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, as a Saviour to ſave him from ſin, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was in a ſinleſs condition, he had no guilt upon him in his Innocency, it was then incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with <hi>Adams</hi> ſtate to believe on Chriſt as a Mediator and Saviour, then it ſeems <hi>Adam</hi> had no power to believe on Chriſt, and if ſo, then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not believing on Chriſt, is not a tranſgreſſion of the firſt Commandment.</p>

               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>For Anſwer to it let me briefly clear this in two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is granted, it is true, that it was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with <hi>Adams</hi> ſtate of Innocency to rely upon Chriſt, and to believe on Chriſt as a Saviour to ſave him from ſin, for he had no ſin, he was In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, therefore it was inconſiſtent with his ſtate to believe on Chriſt as a Saviour; yea, it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the wiſdom of God to require <hi>Adam</hi> to believe on Chriſt, to command ſuch a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Adam;</hi> yet notwithſtanding, (mark I pray) <hi>Adam</hi> had a principle, and a virtual pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for to have believed on Chriſt, if God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it of him; Though its true it was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his ſtate, that God ſhould require it of him, yet <hi>Adam had this principle,</hi> this virtual power put into him with his firſt Creation, in the image of God, <hi>He had this power put into him, that he had a virtual power to obey God in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that he ſhould require of him,</hi> whatever God ſhould reveal to be his will, he had power to believe it, and yield obedience to it: Though it is true it was inconſiſtent with his State actually to believe, yet he had a power to have believed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40096:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> on Chriſt, if God had required it of him. For <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had a power to do that which was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his ſtate of innocency, as for example, <hi>Adam had a Principle and virtual Power to ſhew Mercy and Compaſſion to any that were in miſery, but that was inconſiſtent with his ſtate, for there was none in miſery then.</hi> There was no need of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of <hi>Adam,</hi> yet <hi>Adam</hi> had a principle, a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual power to have done this; ſo in this caſe, though 'tis true, believing on Chriſt as a Saviour was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with his ſtate, yet he had a principle, and virtual power to have believed on Chriſt as a Saviour if God had required it of him, <hi>Or elſe it were not our ſin now not to believe on Chriſt, if there were never a power given to Adam in the ſtate of innocency to have believed, if God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it of him, for we are now condemned for not believing on Chriſt, the power being once given us: Though we have loſt the power,</hi> yet that doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe us for the ſin of Unbelief. That is one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though it is true, Believing on Chriſt was not expreſly required in the firſt Commandment, yet notwithſtanding, <hi>It was and is implicitly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,</hi> namely thus, It was and is required in the firſt Commandment, that we ſhould yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of faith to whatever God ſhould require of us; now then, though Believing on Chriſt was not expreſly required and commanded, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding believing on Chriſt was implicitly required, thus, that when ever God ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal and make Chriſt known to us, when ever God ſhould command us to believe on Chriſt, this was required that we are bound by vertue of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40096:81"/> the firſt Commandment to believe on Chriſt, though 'tis true it was inconſiſtent with that ſtate, yet notwithſtanding it is implicitly required in the firſt Commandment, as to inſtance, You know Goſpel-Worſhip, or the Worſhip that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth now in the Goſpel, it is inconſiſtent with that Worſhip that God required in the time of the Law, yet notwithſtanding, Goſpel-Worſhip was implicitly required in the ſecond Commandment; now 'tis true, Goſpel-Worſhip is not expreſſed in the ſecond Commandment, yet notwithſtanding it is virtually implyed, becauſe we are bound by virtue of that Commandment, to worſhip God with that Worſhip which God ſhould inſtitute or appoint; God hath now appointed Goſpel-Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip under the new Teſtament, and by vertue of the ſecond Commandment, we are bound to yield obedience to it now, though it was inconſiſtent with the Worſhip in the time of the Law. So the fourth Commandment requires that we ſhould keep holy the Sabbath Day, the expreſs letter of the Commandment is to ſanctify the ſeventh day from the Creation; now that we ſhould keep the firſt day of the Week for the Sabbath, under the Goſpel, this is not expreſſed in the fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment; yet it is implicitly required, namely, that we ſhould keep holy that ſeventh day that God hath appointed, or ſhould appoint: If God do change the ſeventh day to the firſt day of the Week, ſtill by vertue of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we are bound to ſanctify and celebrate the firſt day of the week for the Sabbath: ſo now in this caſe, though the firſt Commandment did not expreſly require our faith in Chriſt, yet implicity
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40096:82"/> we are bound by vertue of that Commandment, to yield obedience of faith to whatever God ſhould reveal or make known to us, or command us to believe any time afterward. So that now, if our believing on Chriſt be required in the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, then unbelief is a tranſgreſſion of the firſt Commandment, and ſo a Sin. This is the firſt Demonſtration.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It appears to be a ſin, namely becauſe, <hi>Not believing on Chriſt, is a Tranſgreſſion of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Goſpel,</hi> Not only a Tranſgreſſion of the firſt Table of the Law, but it is a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the great Commandment of the Goſpel. Brethren, the Goſpel is a Law, it is called the law of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.27. <hi>Where then is Boaſting? it is excluded, by what Law? of Works, nay, but by the Law of faith,</hi> What is that; that is the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. The Goſpel is the Law of Faith, wherein God requires our faith and believing on Chriſt, and therefore faith is called the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> Rom. 16.26. <hi>But now is it made manifeſt by the Scriptures of the Prophets, according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the everlaſting God made known to all Nations for the Obedience of faith.</hi> That is, that the Nations ſhould believe on Chriſt, and ſo yield obedience to the Goſpel by believing; it is the Command of the Goſpel, therefore, now not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on Chriſt is a tranſgreſſion of a Goſpel Command. Where doth the Goſpel command our believing on Chriſt expreſly? why every where, to name but a place or two. <hi>John</hi> 6.29. ſaith Chriſt, <hi>This is the Work of God that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent;</hi> This is the work of God, not only the work that God worketh in us,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:40096:82"/> that is not the meaning of the place, but this is the Work that God requires and commands, the ſpecial work and duty that God requires, that you ſhould believe on the name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt. And you have a more expreſs place, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is his Commandment, that ye believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> This is the great Commandment of the Goſpel, that we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the name of Jeſus Chriſt, therefore now not to believe on Chriſt, being commanded in the Goſpel, is a tranſgreſſion of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Goſpel, and the tranſgreſſion of a Goſpel Command is a ſin as well as any tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ten Commandments. Now believing on Chriſt being expreſly required in the Goſpel, unbelief is a tranſgreſſion of the Command of the Goſpel, and therefore it is a ſin: That is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Demonſtration.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Not believing on Chriſt appears to be a ſin, though we make nothing of it, becauſe, <hi>God doth inflict puniſhments for not believing on Chriſt.</hi> God doth puniſh men for not believing on Chriſt. Now God doth never inflict puniſhment for that which is no ſin; puniſhment properly is the conſequent and effect of ſin, where there is no ſin, there is no puniſhment therefore when God takes away the guilt of ſin in Juſtification; then God pardons a ſoul, the ſoul is free from all puniſhment for ſin. There is therefore no condemnation, no real pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment for ſin to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus. Now then that God doth puniſh for unbelief, though not total unbelief, it is apparent. You know <hi>Moſes</hi> was puniſhed for not believing, and honouring of God by believing, at the Waters
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:40096:83"/> 
                     <hi>Meriba,</hi> Numb. 20.12. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes and Aaron, becauſe ye believed me not to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify me in the Eyes of the Children of Iſrael, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye ſhall not bring this Congregation into the Land which I have given them. Moſes</hi> pleaded hard with God, that he might go over and ſee the good Land; ſaith the Lord, ſpeak no more of it, I will not hear you in this thing, you ſhall ſee it indeed but you ſhall not enter into it becauſe you did not honour me by believing. God puniſhes unbelief, and therefore unbelief muſt be a ſin; and ſo the Iſraelites, for their unbelief God did puniſh them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.32, 33. <hi>For all this they ſinned ſtill, and believed not for his wondrous works,</hi> and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? <hi>therefore their days did he conſume in vanity, and their years in trouble.</hi> Therefore God puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them for their unbelief. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.17, 18, 19. ſaith the Apoſtle there, <hi>But with whom was he grieved fourty years? was it not with them that had ſinned?</hi> why? what was their ſin? was it not unbelief? <hi>and to whom ſware he, that they ſhould not enter into his reſt; but to them that believed not?</hi> So we ſee that they could not enter in becauſe of unbelief; ſo that God doth puniſh unbelief, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Chriſt ſhall come in flaming fire to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vengeance on them that obey not the Goſpel;</hi> Now what is obedience to the Goſpel, but believing on Chriſt, which is the great Command of the Goſpel. They ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting vengeance that do not obey the Goſpel. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe things do evidently demonſtrate that not believing on Chriſt is a ſin. That is the firſt: But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Unbelief is not only a ſin, <hi>But it is a very
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:40096:83"/> great ſin,</hi> It is one of the greateſt ſins, one of the ſpecial ſins of all other ſins. It is the Saying of a Reverend Holy Man, ſaith he, <hi>The Sin of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, it is a greater ſin, than Adultery, than Blaſphemy, than Murder, than Sodomy, nay,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>'tis greater than all theſe ſins put them all together.</hi> And methinks, Chriſt here in the Text expreſſing and making mention of this one ſin, above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſins that the Spirit ſhall convince the World of, doth evidence the greatneſs of this ſin; when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He ſhall convince the World of ſin,</hi> he doth not ſay he ſhall convince the World of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or Adultery, or Sodomy, or Blaſphemy — but of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief,</hi> he only mentions this to imply, that this is the moſt provoking ſin of all, and ſo Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>John</hi> 15.22. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken to them, they had not had ſin,</hi> they had had no guilt of ſin at all, in compariſon of this ſin of unbelief, if Chriſt had not come and preached the Goſpel to them, they had not had ſin, that is, no guilt at all in compariſon of this guilt of not believing on Chriſt, this is the ſin of all ſins, this not believing on Chriſt when he is preached and ſet forth. And how doth that appear?</p>
                  <p>To make it a little out that not believing on Chriſt when the Goſpel is preached and Chriſt is tendered, and held forth, that now not to believe on Chriſt is a very great and ſpecial ſin, one of the greateſt of all other ſins. Though for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality thoſe that do look upon unbelief as a ſin, yet they look upon it but as a ſmall matter, and they are but little humbled for the ſin of unbelief, they can be humbled for other ſins, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge other ſins, but as for this ſin of unbelief, it
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:40096:84"/> is very rarely laid to heart in any manner, as it ought to be, becauſe people do not look at this ſin of unbelief as the great ſin, as the ſin above all other ſins. Now a little to demonſtrate this, that if the Lord pleaſe by his Spirit to go along and concur with it, we may be convinced of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this ſin, or elſe 'tis not all I can ſay can convince us of the greatneſs of this Sin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It appears from hence that the ſin of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is a great ſin, namely, <hi>From the greatneſs of the Puniſhment that God doth inflict upon men for this ſin.</hi> God doth puniſh all ſin, but now as for the Sin of unbelief, God doth viſit that, and puniſh that with the greateſt puniſhment, and that argues 'tis a great ſin: God is a righteous and juſt God, and he never puniſheth a ſin beyond what it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6. <hi>He renders to every man according to his works.</hi> Now he renders to unbelievers (to them that do not yield obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of faith to the Goſpel, that are not brought by the Goſpel to believe on Chriſt) he doth ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vengeance with a witneſs unto them, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Chriſt ſhall come in flaming fire,</hi> Chriſt will appear all in a light fire, <hi>to render vengeance upon them that obey not the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel;</hi> he doth not ſay to render vengeance upon them that are adulterous or unclean (though he will render vengeance to them) but here will be the vengeance of all vengeance to them that live under the Goſpel, and have been intreated and perſwaded to accept of Chriſt, and do refuſe it, he ſhall come in flaming fire to render vengeance to them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.22.24. Chriſt is there upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe places where he had been preaching the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:40096:84"/> Goſpel, and they had not received it, <hi>Verſe</hi> 21. <hi>Wo unto thee Chorazin, Wo unto thee Bethſaida, Wo unto thee Capernaum,</hi> Thoſe were the places that had been lifted up to heaven in regard of the means of Salvation, Chriſt came himſelf, and preached the Goſpel to them, but now ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Wo unto you, I tell you, it ſhal be more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than for you;</hi> You know <hi>Sodom</hi> was given to moſt deſperate and abominable wickedneſs, the ſin of Sodomy had its name from <hi>Sodom,</hi> and God did viſit the ſin of Sodom with an exemplary Judgment from Heaven, fire and brimſtone from Heaven, and <hi>Sodom</hi> went down into Hell: Ay, but ſaith Chriſt, their Hell will be a lighter Hell, a leſſer Hell, a more tolerable Hell, than the Hell of thoſe that have lived under the Goſpel, under the preaching of the Goſpel, where Chriſt hath been revealed and held forth, and yet have not yielded obedience of faith; I tell you, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>It ſhall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha, in the day of Judgment, than for thoſe places.</hi> And I remember what Chriſt ſpake in the Parable, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.46. about that Servant that ſaid in his heart, <hi>My Lord delayeth his coming,</hi> and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on fell to eating, and drinking, and abuſing his fellow-ſervants, <hi>The Lord of that Servant will come in a day that he looketh not for him, and in an hour when he is not aware, and will cut him in ſunder, and will appoint him his portion with unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> he doth not ſay he will appoint him his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with murderers and unprofitable Servants, but amongſt unbelievers, as if the portion of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers was the greateſt portion of wrath of all
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:40096:85" rendition="simple:additions"/> others, he will appoint him his portion with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers. Brethren, from the very vengeance and puniſhment that God doth viſit and puniſh unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief withall, we may eaſily conclude and gather, that unbelief is one of the greateſt ſins.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That unbelief is ſuch a great ſin (and Oh! that the Lord would open our Eyes, that we may ſee it and be made ſenſible of it), it appears, (though people are leaſt ſenſible of it) <hi>Becauſe it is that which doth caſt the greateſt reproach upon God of all other ſin,</hi> It caſts the greateſt reproach upon the God of truth, it ſtrikes at the very Being of God, though people do not conſider it; I ſay, unbelief, or not believing on Chriſt, it ſtrikes at the very Being of God, he is a God of Truth: Truth is the very eſſential Property of God, it is his very Being, his very Eſſence, for he is a God of Truth, and in compariſon of him, all men in the World are liars, <hi>Let God be true, and every men a liar,</hi> Rom. 3.4. He is ſo infinitely true, that he is Truth it ſelf; and it is impoſſible for him to lie, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. God muſt ceaſe to be God, if any untruth ſhould be found in him; and yet now mark, Unbelief doth caſt ſo great a reproach upon God, as to ſay, God is a liar; You have it expreſly, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10, 11. <hi>He that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not on the Son of God, hath made God a liar, becauſe he believeth not the record that God hath given of his Son;</hi> Now what is the record that God hath given of his Son? <hi>Verſe</hi> 11. <hi>This is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that God hath given to us, Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son.</hi> Here is the Record, that God from Heaven doth hold forth in the Goſpel, here is eternal life, and Salvation to be
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:40096:85" rendition="simple:additions"/> had through Jeſus Chriſt to every one that doth believe; this is the great Truth that the Goſpel doth hold forth, now ſuch as do not receive this Truth and Teſtimony, Unbelievers that remain in their unbelief, they go on every day to make God a liar.</p>

               <div type="question">
                  <head>Queſtion.</head>
                  <p>But you will ſay, how do we by unbelief make God a liar?</p>
               </div>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>Anſwer.</head>
                  <p>How? briefly thus, When a Soul goes on not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding God holds forth this Record, that here is Eternal Life to be had by believing on Chriſt, this is the great Truth that God doth bear witneſs to in the Goſpel, now when people do no more regard this ſo great Truth, though it be daily held forth to them, yet they regard it no more than they do the Words of one that they know to be an arrant Liar. Now one that is known to be a liar, if he ſhould promiſe a man never ſo much, he would make no great matter of it, he promiſeth to furniſh him with mony at his need — but he doth not truſt to it, he knows he is a liar, and therefore he is fain to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for himſelf, as well as he can. Thus it is, God doth promiſe eternal life to the ſoul that doth accept of Jeſus Chriſt, if you will believe on Chriſt here is eternal life for you, this is the great Truth that God doth bear witneſs to in the Goſpel, now this Goſpel is preached, and publiſhed, and proclaimed. Now when people have no more regard to this great Truth of the Goſpel, than
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:40096:86"/> they have to the words of a liar, then they make God a liar; they ſay this is a lie, let God ſay what he will, I will not believe a word of it, but we will look for ſalvation another way, we will ſhift for our ſelves as well as we can by our own duties and ſervices, we will find the life in our own hands; ſo long as any poor ſoul goes on in a courſe of unbelief, he goes on continually to ſay that God is a liar. O Brethren! would it not make your ears tingle, and your hearts ake, to hear a man go up and down the ſtreets, ſaying, God is a liar, I will not believe one word that he ſaith; you would ſay, if the man were in his wits, it is pity that he is ſuffered to live, thus to blaſpheme the true God; Why truly, this is the caſe and courſe of every one that lives under the Goſpel, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Record that God doth bear concerning Jeſus Chriſt, and eternal life to be had in him, and yet they go on in a courſe and ſtate of unbelief, and make nothing of all this, they do proclaim and ſay that God is a liar, and I do not believe one word that he ſaith what deſperate and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible blaſphemy is this? It may be you make no great matter of this, but notwithſtanding thus it is, the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>He that believeth not the Record that God hath given of his Son, he makes God a liar.</hi> And is not this a great ſin? to ſtrike at the very Being of God; for if God be not a God of Truth, he muſt ceaſe to be God.</p>
                  <p>That is the ſecond Demonſtration, That Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief as it is a ſin, ſo it is the greateſt of ſins. But then,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Unbelief appears to be a great ſin, Becauſe it is that whereby people do deſpiſe with the greateſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:40096:86"/> deſpite the greateſt kindneſs and favour that God can ſhew to poor creatures; they do as it were ſpurn and kick away the kindneſs of God, with a ſpurn of the foot. God in the Goſpel doth hold forth the greateſt kindneſs, and favour, that can be ſhown to poor ſinners, he offers to them life and ſalvation, peace, and pardon, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation. — Now for perſons not to regard this, O! it is a deſpiſing with the greateſt deſpite, the higheſt kindneſs and favour that God can ſhew to poor ſinners. I pray do but conſider three or four things, that you may ſee what a high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it is of the greateſt kindneſs that can be ſhown to poor creatures.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Conſider but the State and Condition of thoſe to whom God doth offer and tender his Grace in the Goſpel? What are they to whom God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims his Goſpel, and offers pardon, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and peace, and life, and ſalvation? Who are they? A company of poor condemned creatures, that are under the ſentence of eternal death and condemnation, poor hopeleſs, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, undone creatures; We are all under a ſentence of eternal death continually, ſo long as we are in a ſtate of unbelief. <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth it ſhall dy:</hi> God hath pronounced this ſentence upon every ſinners head; Now that God ſhould offer and tender, and ſhew himſelf ready to ſhew kindneſs unto poor undone creatures, poor condemned creatures, condemned to eternal death, and for ſuch poor creatures to ſlight this kindneſs, Is not this a ſin and provocation with a witneſs? Is it not a great kindneſs for a King to ſhew ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to a poor condemned creature, that is ready
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:40096:87"/> to the Gallows, if the King ſhould ſend him his pardon? It would be counted a kindneſs and a favour indeed. Truly Brethren, we are all condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned creatures, ſentenced to eternal death, now that God ſhould be pleaſed to have any intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good will and favour towards ſuch as we are, eſpecially if you conſider the ſtate of Angels, that fell, and are under a ſentence of eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, that God ſhould leave them hopeleſs, and helpleſs for ever, paſs by them, and ſhew favour to poor ſinful mankind, here is a favour and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs indeed: We might all have periſhed, and God had loſt nothing at all, he had been infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glorious and juſt for ever. And then again.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider how God hath ſet his infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on work to contrive and find out a way, to manifeſt his goodneſs and favour to poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which all the Angels in Heaven could never have done, that there ſhould be a way found out to ſave ſinners, that have infinitely offended and wronged the juſtice of God, and yet the juſtice of God not ſuffer! here is the infinite wiſdom of God ſet on work to find out this way. Brethren, there was a great deal of the Wiſdom of God ſeen in the contrivance of the World, and of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, framing of the Creation. Saith the Pſalmiſt, ſpeaking of the creatures, <hi>In Wiſdom haſt thou made them all,</hi> Pſal. 104.24. Ay, there is much of the Wiſdom of God ſeen in the creation of the World. <hi>The Heavens declare the Glory of God,</hi> Ay, but Brethren, in the work of the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of loſt man, ſhewing grace, and favour, and kindneſs to poor undone creatures as we are, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in appears the manifold Wiſdom of God. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10.
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:40096:87"/> 
                     <hi>To the intent that now, unto the Principalities and Powers in heavenly places might be made known by the Church the manifold Wiſdom of God.</hi> Here was Wiſdom and manifold Wiſdom, Wiſdom upon Wiſdom, to find out a way for God to ſhew kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and favour to poor condemned creatures as we are. And then</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Conſider further that you may ſee the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God about the ſalvation of man. Conſider that God ſhould make it known that he is freely and fully willing to ſave undone creatures, that he is willing to ſave any poor ſinner that is willing to venture on Chriſt, to lay hold on him by Faith; it was the great intendment of God in ſending his Son from Heaven to be made a man, and to be made under the Law, and to ſuffer the wrath and Curſe of God for the transgreſſion of the Law, to make peace and attonement for ſinners, here is now the manifold Wiſdom of God, the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Wiſdom of God, and that God ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal this, and make this known unto poor ſinners, that God is freely willing and fully willing that poor ſinners find grace in his ſight, that they might have pardon and reconciliation, whoſoever they be that will believe on Chriſt, and accept of him. And not only ſo, But</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider that God ſhould ſend his Servants, and Meſſengers about, up and down the World, for that end, that he might ſhew favour and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to poor ſinners, he ſends them in his name to publiſh and proclaim his Grace, to make known his everlaſting Goſpel unto poor ſinners. <hi>Go,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Preach the Goſpel,</hi> and tell them, <hi>He that believeth ſhall be ſaved, and he
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:40096:88"/> that believeth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> There will be his puniſhment. Now Brethren put all theſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, here is kindneſs and grace indeed; that God ſhould have favour for poor undone ſinful creatures as we are, that are ſentenced to eternal death, and that he ſhould come and offer it and tender it as he doth. Now conſider what a ſin it is, not to receive it, not to embrace it, and accept of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to ſlight it, and refuſe and deſpiſe it, as every unbeliever doth. God comes and offers eternal life and ſalvation in the Goſpel, if you will receive it, you ſhall be ſaved; if you do venture your ſouls upon it, you ſhall be eternally ſaved: now for poor creatures, as it were, to kick this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with the foot, to ſpurn at this grace and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, to caſt it behind your back as not worthy the regarding, you will ſay, certainly, this cannot be but a very great and high provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: As now, ſuppoſe, the King ſhould ſend a pardon to a poor condemned Malefactor, and he ſhould take the pardon, and caſt it behind his back; you will ſay this mans caſe is very ſad. This is the caſe of every unbelieving ſoul; the pardon that God offers in the Goſpel, he makes a very wiſp of it, and caſts it behind his back. Now conſider, if this be not a ſin; doth not this deſerve condemnation with a witneſs? <hi>This is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> — That is the third.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let me name one more, that if the Lord pleaſe to open our Eyes, we may ſee a little more into the evil of this ſin of unbelief. <hi>Our not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving on Chriſt, is the higheſt Contempt put upon the eternal Son of God that can be;</hi> In refuſing and ſlighting of Chriſt, we trample upon the Blood
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:40096:88"/> of the infinite, and eternal, and beloved Son of God. You will ſay, that is a ſin with a witneſs indeed, if a man ſhould have taken the Blood of Chriſt, that ran out of his ſide, and ſtampt it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet in diſdain and contempt, you will ſay, that mans ſin is a very great ſin. Brethren, thoſe that have Jeſus Chriſt offered, and tendered to them, (as Jeſus Chriſt is tendered and offered to every ſinner that ſits under the Goſpel) there is his Blood offered and tendered to us; now if we refuſe it, we do as it were trample upon the very Blood of the Son of God. 'Tis the expreſſion of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Who have trodden under foot the Son of God,</hi> They trample the very Blood of the Son of God under their feet. Brethren, Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel comes and tenders him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he tenders his Blood, the price and merit of his Blood, here is peace, here is pardon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, here is eternal life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, the very price of my Blood. Now for us to make nothing of all this, to make no more of the Blood of Chriſt, than we would do of the Blood of a Beaſt, certainly this cannot but be a very high Provocation. I remember the Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. of a Vineyard that was let out to Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, ſo the Maſter of the Vineyard ſent in ſeaſon for the fruit of his Vineyard: well, 'tis ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 31. <hi>The husbandmen took his Servants and beat one, and killed another, and ſtoned another; at laſt ſaith the Maſter of the Vineyard, I will ſend my Son, they will reverence my Son;</hi> and at <hi>v.</hi> 38. <hi>When they ſaw the Son, they uſed him as deſpitefully and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully as the other.</hi> What ſhall become of thoſe huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen that inſtead of reverencing his Son, they
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40096:89"/> caſt him out of the Vineyard and ſlew him? 'Tis ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 40. <hi>When the Lord of the Vineyard comes he will miſerably deſtroy thoſe husbandmen.</hi> Why, Brethren, this is the caſe of every unbelieving ſoul, the Son of God comes and tenders his Blood, here is my hearts blood, the price of my Blood which I have ſhed, he tenders it to us to accept of it, to accept of peace, and pardon, and ſalvation, which is the price of my Blood, and we make no account of it, is not this a high provocation? and do we not deſerve to be miſerably deſtroyed?</p>
                  <p>So now you have ſeen the ſecond thing opened, <hi>That unbelief is not only a ſin, but it is a great ſin; one of the greateſt ſins of all others,</hi> And O! that we had eyes to ſee it. But then,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To ſhew you, that it is the work of the Spirit in order to Converſion, to convince a Soul, as of other ſins, ſo eſpecially of this great ſin of unbelief. I ſhall briefly name two or three things to ſhew you what the Spirit doth in order to the convincing of the ſoul of this great ſin of unbelief, you ſhall find uſually that the Spirit in convincing a ſoul of unbelief, in order to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and eternal ſalvation, it uſually doth theſe three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Spirit doth come and reveal to the Soul the great evil of the ſin of unbelief,</hi> ſets it before the ſoul, and makes it to ſee it, therefore the Spirit is called the Spirit of Revelation, becauſe it doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal the Goſpel, and the great ſin that is againſt the Goſpel. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17. <hi>That God would give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revelation.</hi> Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, it is not natural Conſcience that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a man of the ſin of unbelief. A natural
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:40096:89"/> Conſcience may poſſibly help to convince a ſoul of other ſins, it may check the ſoul for other ſins, as Murder or Blaſphemy, — For indeed a natural Conſcience is ready to accuſe of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Their Conſciences in the mean while, excuſing or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing one another.</hi> Natural Conſcience may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for ſome ſins, but not for this ſin of unbelief. The Law may help a ſoul to be convinced of ſome ſins that are expreſly againſt the Law, but the law cannot convince any man or woman of unbelief, no, though 'tis true as I ſaid before, <hi>That believing on Chriſt is virtually required in the firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> yet it is not expreſly commanded, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly implicitly, and virtually, therefore it is not in the power of the law of the Commandments to help to convince a ſoul of the ſin of unbelief, no more than the ſecond Commandment is a means and inſtrument to convince us of our neglect of Goſpel worſhip, becauſe it is not expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded there but implicitly and conſequentially; Therefore I ſay it muſt be the work of the Spirit alone, to convince of the ſin of unbelief. The Law and Conſcience may help to convince the Soul of other ſins, but none but the Spirit of God can convince the ſoul of the evil of the ſin of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief. This is the firſt thing that the Spirit doth in the ſoul, in order to the convincing of it of the ſin of unbelief, namely, to open the eyes of the underſtanding, and to reveal and diſcover to the ſoul, the evil that is in the ſin of unbelief.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Another work of the Spirit in order to it is this, namely, to cauſe the Soul to underſtand and know plainly that all his beſt duties and ſervices that he can perform in this World cannot be acceptable
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:40096:90"/> unto God, nor make his perſon acceptable without faith in Chriſt.</hi> Truly this now is the work of the Spirit to convince a Soul of this, to diſcover this, that it is not all my duties, and ſervices, and performances, that can procure my acceptance with God without faith in Chriſt. Brethren, this the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks in Scripture, and this the Holy Ghoſt makes a ſoul ſenſible of, <hi>That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> The ſoul, it may be, is ready to think that he can pleaſe God with the performance of duties and ſervices,— But when the Spirit of God comes to convince the ſoul of the ſin of unbelief, it ſhews him that all theſe things are not pleaſing to God, but are diſpleaſing to him without faith in Chriſt; neither our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, nor any thing we can do, can be accepted of God without faith; <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved,</hi> Our perſons are accepted in the Beloved, and our ſervices are accepted in the Beloved, in Chriſt, and through Chriſt; otherwiſe nothing can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted and pleaſing to God that we can do; and hereby now, by the operations of the Spirit, the Soul comes to ſee the ſad and miſerable Eſtate of unbelief. That is the ſecond.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Another Work that the Spirit doth in order to convince a Soul of the Sin of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, is this; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to cauſe the Soul to ſee plainly, that it hath been out of the Way of Salvation all this time.</hi> The Soul hath gone on it may be in a courſe of duties, and ſervices, and performances, it hath been careful and ſtrict to walk exactly, to wrong no body, to be diligent in its calling, to be careful in all its dealings, to be abundant in duties and ſervices,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:40096:90"/> giving attendance to the Word, waiting upon God in every Ordinance. The Soul goes on in this way, and thinks now it is in a way of ſalvation. I would not diſcourage and diſhearten any from going on in ſuch a way, but ſtill without faith this is not the way, we are out of the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and we are all of us naturally enclined to ſeek for ſalvation in this way, in walking exactly, and being conſcientious in the performance of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and being diligent in our vocations and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, this was the way wherein the poor Iſraelites did miſcarry, and periſh. Saith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30.31. <hi>What ſhall we ſay, that the Gentiles which followed not after Righteouſneſs, have attained to Righteouſneſs: but Iſrael which followed after the Law of Righteouſneſs, hath not attained to the Law of Righteouſneſs; wherefore? becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law.</hi> Ay, they went about, ſaith the Apoſtle, to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, and ſo would not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Righteouſneſs of God. They went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs; truly this is natural to every one, to walk on in the way of the Covenant of Works, to look for life in that way that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have found life in if he had continued in his obedience; I ſay, 'tis natural for every one to walk on in ſuch a courſe, to expect eternal life and ſalvation in that way, whereas when the Spirit of God comes to convince a Soul of the ſin of unbelief, it makes the ſoul to ſee it hath been out of the way of life and ſalvation all this time; I have taken a wrong courſe all this time, and now the Soul begins to be amazed to think he hath loſt all his time and all his labour,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:40096:91"/> and now the Soul ſees that this is not the way to life and ſalvation, but the way of ſalvation is in the way of believing on Chriſt, and now the ſoul is ſet in that way and courſe of believing on Chriſt, and this is the Word behind us, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.21. <hi>Thou ſhalt hear a voice behind thee, ſaying, this is the way walk in it.</hi> The Spirit of the Lord comes and whiſpers in our ear, and tells us this is the way of life and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, you will never find life by your own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but this is the way walk in it, if you would find life. Thus the Holy Ghoſt doth ordinarily thoſe three things in order to the convincing a Soul of the ſin of unbelief. So now you have heard the Point opened and cleared. Now to make a little Application in a word or two, and ſo I have done.</p>

                  <p>Hence we may ſee the reaſon why ſo many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors do ſee ſo little evil in the ſin of unbelief, why and whence is it that ſo many Profeſſors are ſo little ſenſible of the ſin of unbelief; though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief be ſuch a great ſin, the greateſt of all ſins, as you have heard, though it be ſuch a ſin as to make God a liar, and it doth kick and ſpurn away the loving kindneſs of God, and by our not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving we put the greateſt contempt upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God that can be, yet I fear there are very few Chriſtians do really and truly ſee the greatneſs of this ſin, they can be humbled for other ſins, and confeſs how they have provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God by ſlighting and deſpiſing his Word, by
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:40096:91" rendition="simple:additions"/> being formal and careleſs and wanton,— and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaning Sabbaths and Ordinances,— but this ſin of unbelief is little laid to heart, there is little real humiliation for that, and what is the reaſon? becauſe it is the work of the Spirit of Chriſt only to convince of this ſin. And therefore as we do deſire more and more to ſee the evil of this ſin of unbelief, truly we had need to look up for the Spirit to diſcover it to us, that all that we can do can never pleaſe God, unleſs we do believe on Chriſt, whatever prayers we make, whatever du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we perform, yet all doth not pleaſe God, but we muſt be accepted only by faith in Chriſt, and it is the work of the Spirit to ſhew us how we have been out of the way of ſalvation all this time; I have gone on in a courſe of duties and performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a way of moral Righteouſneſs, but I have been out of the way of life and ſalvation all this time. If the Spirit do not convince us, we ſhall never be convinced of this ſin of unbelief, it is not all that I have ſpoken, nor all that all the Saints in the World can ſpeak in laying open this ſin of unbelief, that can convince us of it, except the Spirit of the Lord come and convince of this ſin of unbelief. Therefore look up for the Spirit, and wait for the Spirit to be given out to convince us of this ſin of unbelief. That is the firſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To end all, hereby we may come in ſome meaſure to diſcern our ſpiritual eſtate and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether we be in a way of ſalvation or no, Brethren, you may ſee it plainly in the Text, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I will ſend the Spirit, and he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the World of ſin,</hi> of this ſin of unbelief in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſalvation.

               <p>I confeſs I had it in my thoughts to have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to ſome other ſubject at this time, but caſting about and conſidering with my ſelf what might be of moſt and greateſt concernment, the Lord was pleaſed to turn my thoughts again upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for verily if it were the laſt Sermon that ever I ſhould preach to you in this world (as the Lord knows whether it be or no) if ſo be that any of you were going out of the World, and I ſhould be called to ſpeak to you, I do not know what I ſhould ſay, that is of more or greater concernment: If I were immediately to go out of the World, and were to preach my laſt Farewel Sermon, I know not what Truth to commend to you of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment than this, of the Righteouſneſs which the Spirit doth convince the world of, in order to their Salvation.</p>
               <p>Now that I may open it to you, if the Lord pleaſe, and the Lord open our hearts that we may underſtand it. I ſhall only ſpeak to theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew you in the general what we are to underſtand by <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. To ſhew you more particularly what this <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is, which is the work of the Spirit to convince us of. And,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Shew you, How, or in what way uſually
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:40096:94"/> the Spirit doth convince a Soul of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> or what work the Spirit doth in a Soul in order to the convincing it of <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall bound my diſcourſe in ſpeaking to theſe three particulars if the Lord pleaſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, <hi>What are we to underſtand by Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in the general;</hi> for that will make way for our underſtanding what this <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is. In the general then, <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is nothing elſe but a perfect exact conformity to the Law of God, or to the revealed Will of God; an exact confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to it both in Heart and Life: That is <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> in the general. I ſay, a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the whole Will of God revealed, not only in the outward converſation, but in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward frame of the Heart and Soul. You know when <hi>Adam</hi> was at firſt created, when he came immediately out of the hands of God, he was made perfectly righteous, <hi>God made Man upright,</hi> that is, <hi>Righteous:</hi> Well, wherein did that <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> conſiſt? What was the <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> was created in? It is ſaid, <hi>He was made in the Image of God.</hi> Now wherein did the Image of God in <hi>Adam</hi> lye? What, only in the conformity of his outward actions to the Law and Will of God? No alas! that was the leaſt part of the Image of God in <hi>Adam:</hi> but <hi>Adam</hi> was made in the Image of God Upright, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Holy in his inward man, eſpecially in his Soul, he was made exactly conformable to the Will of God in every thing that he required of him, and therefore now when <hi>Adam</hi> did ſin and fall, he loſt the Image of God, he loſt that <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> that was in his inward man, and you ſee,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:40096:94"/> after his fall it is ſaid, <hi>That every imagination of the thought of mans heart were only evil, and that continually,</hi> Gen. 6.5. Not only every acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that he did was evil, no, but the very thoughts of his heart, the inward frame of his heart and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit was only evil, and that continually, therefore on the contrary, his Righteouſneſs did conſiſt in the conformity of his inward man to the Law and Will of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.7, 8. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He that doth righteouſneſs is righteous; he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth ſin is of the Devil, but he that doth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is righteous.</hi> Every ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law, ſo that now when a man or woman is exactly conformable to the whole Will of God, not only in his outward converſation, but alſo in his very thoughts and frame of his heart, then he is ſaid to be perfectly righteous, this is perfect Righteouſneſs. For, Brethren, a man may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be outwardly conformable to the Letter of the Law, and yet not be righteous in the account of the Holy Ghoſt; as the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> you know, were very righteous in reſpect of the Letter of the Law, Ay, but ſaith Chriſt, they are inwardly unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and therefore he tells them, <hi>They were like whited Sepulchres which appeare beautiful outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but inwardly are full of corruption and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;</hi> therefore ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept your Righteouſneſs exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, you ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> They were very righteous and exact as to the Letter of the Law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was a Phariſee, <hi>Touching the Righteouſneſs of the Law, blameleſs.</hi> The Phariſees were exact as to the Letter of the Law, but ſtill
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:40096:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> they did not look to their inſide, to their heart, there they were unrighteous: ſo that by this you ſee what is meant by Righteouſneſs in general, It is to be perfectly and exactly conformable to the whole Will and Law of God revealed both in heart and life. That in general.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But, <hi>Let us in the ſecond place enquire a little more particularly, What is this Righteouſneſs here which Chriſt ſaith, the Spirit ſhall convince the World of?</hi> What Righteouſneſs doth Chriſt here mean? Brethren, <hi>It cannot be meant of a man's own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that the Spirit doth convince of; for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth rather convince men of their own <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;</hi> therefore it cannot be a mans own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Therefore ſaith <hi>Paul, I would not for all the world be found in mine own Righteouſneſs,</hi> Phil. 3.9. Neither is it that Righteouſneſs which is called the Righteouſneſs of the Law, for that is ſtill the ſame with a man's own Righteouſneſs, which is when a man is obedient to the Letter of the Law, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in that third of <hi>Philip.</hi> 9. <hi>And be found in him, not having on my own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law.</hi> — Well, what Righteouſneſs then is it which Chriſt here ſpeaks of, when he ſaith, <hi>The Spirit ſhall convince the World of Righteouſneſs;</hi> What Righteouſneſs is it?</p>
               <p>In brief, <hi>It is that Righteouſneſs which is called the Righteouſneſs of God, in oppoſition to a mans own Righteouſneſs.</hi> The Righteouſneſs of God, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.3. And ſo in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <hi>The Jews being ignorant of the Righteouſneſs of God, went about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> So that the one is ſet in oppoſition againſt
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:40096:95" rendition="simple:additions"/> the other: A mans own Righteouſneſs and God's Righteouſneſs is contrary, diſtinſt, and in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to one another. The Righteouſneſs of God is that Righteouſneſs which God himſelf doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire in order to our ſalvation; and it is that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which God will accept of, and no other righteouſneſs for our ſalvation; and this Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is alſo called, <hi>The Righteouſneſs of Faith, Rom.</hi> 10.16. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30. He calleth it, <hi>The Righteouſneſs which is of Faith,</hi> becauſe it comes in, in a way of faith and believing.</p>
               <div type="question">
                  <head>Queſtion.</head>
                  <p>Now you will ſay, <hi>Wherein lies the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the one Righteouſneſs and the other? That we may underſtand things as we go along. Wherein lies the difference between that which is called our own Righteouſneſs, and the Righteouſneſs of the Law, and that which is called the Righteouſneſs of God and the Righteouſneſs of Faith?

                     </hi> I ſay it is that Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that Jeſus Chriſt fulfilled in our humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he was made of a Woman, and made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law, and being made under the Law, he was in our Nature perfectly to fulfill the whole Law, every tittle of it, and ſo he did, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may obſerve, from his very conception to his death, he was perfectly conformable to the whole will of God; in his very conception, he was conceived and born without ſin, ſaith the Angel to the Virgin <hi>Mary, That holy thing that ſhall be born of thee,</hi> — he was holy in his very Conception, <hi>Conceived by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and he was a Lamb without ſpot, we were all conceived in ſin, and brought forth in iniquity, but Chriſt was without ſin in his very conception, and that is much for the comfort of Believers, to think: Our nature is ſtained and polluted by ſin, how ſhall we be accepted of God? why here is the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Chriſt without ſpot, and we ſhall be accepted for his ſake, and Chriſt in the whole Courſe of his life was altogether without ſin, he knew no ſin, as 'tis expreſſed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He knew no ſin,</hi> that is, no ſin of his own, he had ſin enough laid upon him, imputed to him, but he had no ſin of his own, there was no guile found in his mouth, he did always thoſe things that pleaſed the Father, <hi>John</hi> 28.29. he never ſpake one idle word; no, but ſaith he, <hi>Whatever I ſpake
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:40096:96"/> I had it by Commmandment from my Father,</hi> he was blameleſs in his whole life, and therefore when he came to lay down his life, to reſign up himſelf to his Father, he appeals to his Father, whether he had not done all the Work he had given him to do, <hi>I have finiſhed the Work</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which thou gaveſt me to do, and now I come to thee.</hi> Nay, Brethren, he was righteous and holy not only to his death, but alſo in his death, he was obedient and conformable to the will of God, therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8. <hi>He became obedient to the very death,</hi> Thus I ſay Chriſt was perfectly righteous. Now it is this Righteouſneſs of Chriſt in our nature that the Spirit convinces the World of, that a ſoul muſt look to be accepted and ſaved only for the ſake of this Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.

Well to give you two or three Arguments briefly upon Scripture Ground, to prove to you, that if ever we be accepted of God it muſt be through the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt doth plainly and expreſly hold forth this to us in Scripture.</hi> See a few Scriptures for it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.21. <hi>The Lord is well pleaſed for his Righteouſneſs ſake.</hi> A very gracious and bleſſed word, <hi>The Lord is well pleaſed for his own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſake,</hi> not for that which is our own, for

                  <p>For Anſwer, plainly in a word, the reaſon is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>Believers though they be made righteous by the very righteouſneſs of Chriſt, yet notwithſtanding they are not made righteous with that righteouſneſs, in that manner that Chriſt was righteous, Chriſt was righteous inherently in his own perſon, but now the righteouſneſs, that we are made righteous withall, it is ours only by imputation,</hi> That, look now, as it was with Chriſt, Chriſt was made ſin for us, ſaith

Now the reaſon why Chriſt did not make others ſinners, by the ſin that he had, as <hi>Adam</hi> made his poſterity ſinners, the reaſon is becauſe Chriſt was not a ſinner as <hi>Adam</hi> was, that is, not Inherently in himſelf, but by way of imputation. So now, we are righteous by Chriſts righteouſneſs only in a way of imputation, and therefore we cannot derive and communicate this righteouſneſs to another. I ſay, here is the reaſon of it, That though we be made righteous with the perfect righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, yet we are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by made Mediators, and able to impute righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto others, to make them righteous with our righteouſnes.</p>

                  <p>Why, in ſhort, for I muſt not enlarge, we are to follow after righteouſneſs, to be exactly righteous in our lives, and dealings, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations, and to be obedient in duty, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:40096:99"/> in waiting upon God in his Ordinances; we are thus to follow after righteouſneſs, not that we may be accepted of God for any thing that we can do in this world, not that we may be ſaved for any thing we can do or ſuffer here; we may do and ſuffer very much, and yet be damned for all that, but, <hi>We are to follow after righteouſneſs and holineſs, partly by a way of thanksgiving unto God,</hi> for his grace and goodneſs to us, <hi>partly in a way of obedience to the Will of God, and alſo that we may maintain our peace that we have with God by walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſely, and uprightly with him.</hi> He that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth according to this rule, peace be upon him. Now by walking ſinfully and unrighteouſly we loſe the ſence of our peace with God, but now by walking uprightly and cloſely with God, we come to maintain the ſenſe of our peace; and I might further add, <hi>By this means we come to enjoy more communion with God,</hi> by waiting upon God in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties and ordinances, this is the means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God comes to meet with us, and manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to us, but this is not to obtain ſalvation for us, or forgiveneſs of ſins, no, that is the work and power of Chriſts righteouſneſs alone; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, though a Believer be made righteous with the perfect righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, yet it is the duty of Believers to follow hard after righteouſneſs. So now, you have heard the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thing opened, namely, what that righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs in particuiar is which Chriſt ſpeaks of, when he ſaith the Spirit ſhall convince the World of righteouſneſs, that is, of this righteouſneſs of God, this righteouſneſs which is by faith, the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt in our nature, this
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:40096:100"/> is the righteouſneſs which the Spirit convinceth the World of in order to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But then you will ſay in the third place (to come to that) But how doth the Spirit convince of righteouſneſs in order to ſalvation? You have heard what Bighteouſneſs in general is, and what this righteouſneſs in particular is. <hi>Now to ſhew you, that it is the work of the Spirit to convince of righteouſneſs.</hi> Now what doth the Spirit do in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the convincing a ſoul of this righteouſneſs in order to its ſalvation? Briefly this, I ſhall deſire to open to you in two or three particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>The Spirit in convincing a Soul of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs takes the Soul off from reſting upon or cloſing with his own righteouſneſs,</hi> not from ſeeking and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after its own righteouſneſs, but from reſting and truſting, and leaning upon its own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; from looking to be accepted of God to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the account of its own righteouſneſs. This the Spirit of God doth take a ſoul from, in order to convincing it of righteouſneſs. Truly Brethren, this is the rock that we are all of us na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally prone to daſh upon, and to ſplit upon; we are all of us naturally prone to ſeek after accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with God upon the account of our own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, to run on in the way of the Covenant of Works, to ſeek for ſalvation in that way that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have been ſaved in if he had ſtood. <hi>Doe,</hi> and <hi>Live,</hi> be obedient to the Will of God, be exactly righteous, and you ſhall have life, this is the way that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have had life in, if he had continued in his obedience; but now this way of the Covenant of Works is null'd, and we cannot look for ſalvation in that way, but we are
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:40096:100"/> all of us naturally prone to run on in that way, to look for the life of our ſouls meerly by our own righteouſneſs; This was the ſtumbling ſtone that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtumbled at, this was the great rock of offence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.31, 32, 33. ſaith he, <hi>The Gentiles which followed not after righteouſneſs, have attained righteouſneſs, but the Jews which followed after righteouſneſs, have not attained righteouſneſs,</hi> why ſo? becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtumbled at that ſtumbling ſtone, they ſought after righteouſneſs by the works of the law, they ſought to be righteous with their own righteouſneſs, and therefore mark what he ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.3. <hi>They being ignorant of Gods righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, have not ſubmitted themſelves to the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> This is natural to us to look to be accepted of God for our own righteouſneſs, and truly it is a very hard thing for a ſoul to be taken off from that, and therefore hence it is, that the people that are morally righteous, and not ſo notoriouſly wicked and prophane as others are, are ordinarily harder to be convinced and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted than others are, ſo that as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. <hi>Publicans and Harlots ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven before you,</hi> ſpeaking to the Scribes and Phariſees that were exact to the letter of the law. I ſay we are all apt naturally to ſtick there, &amp; to run upon the rock of our own righteouſneſs, juſt as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of himſelf when he was a Phariſee, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. <hi>I was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>concerning the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Law blameleſs,</hi> but afterwards when the Spirit of the Lord had convinced him of his own unrighteouſneſs, and the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, at the 8 and 9 <hi>Verſes,</hi> Now ſaith he, <hi>I
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:40096:101"/> would be found in him not having on my own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs which is of the Law,</hi> that righteouſneſs that I had when I was a Phariſee; <hi>I would not be found</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>having on my own righteouſneſs, but that righteouſneſs which is by faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Now I ſay we are very hardly brought off from our own righteouſneſs, to cloſe with this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt: but now it is the work of the Spirit in convincing a ſoul of righteouſneſs, to take the ſoul off from its own righteouſneſs, and therefore the Spirit is fain to take pains with the Soul, to ſhew it that all its own righteouſneſs will come to nothing. And therefore do but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the way and method of the Spirit of God, what the Spirit of God doth ordinarily when it taketh a Soul off from its own righteouſneſs: The Spirit of God comes therefore and cauſeth the Soul to ſee, not only its own ſinfulneſs by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious open wickedneſs and prophaneſs that it hath lived in, it doth not only convince the Soul of its profaning of Sabbaths, and its diſobedience to Parents, and lying and ſtealing, — and pilfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and diſhoneſty, — when a Soul ſees that then it cannot be accepted of God for its own righteouſneſs. And not only ſo, but the Spirit of the Lord doth diſcover to the Soul the ſecret evils of his heart, inward ſins that never ſaw the light of the Sun, that the World never knew of, The Spirit of the Lord comes and convinces of thoſe wickedneſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:40096:101"/> What? is this the righteouſneſs (ſaith the Soul) that I look to be accepted for? And not only ſo, but the Spirit alſo doth d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now Brethren when the Spirit of the Lord comes and opens a mans heart to himſelf, that he ſees the very frame and diſpoſition of his heart is ſet againſt God, and the will of God in every thing, then the Soul muſt needs be convinced that it can never be accepted of God for its own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, the Soul ſees that it hath no righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:40096:102"/> at all in it ſelf to reſt upon. And not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but the Spirit of the Lord in this convincing a Soul of righteouſneſs, diſcovers to a Soul that this is not the way, where by it can look for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God by all that ever he can do, it is true indeed this was the way that <hi>Adam</hi> in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency ſhould have found life and ſalvation in, but ſince the Fall, that Covenant is broken and null'd, and now God hath no where promiſed to give life and ſalvation in the way of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, no God hath nulled that way of Salvation by our own works and doings, that if ſo be now it were poſſible a man or a woman to be perfectly obedient to the whole law, yet he may go to hell, and be damned for all that, becauſe now God is not bound nor engaged to beſtow eternal life and ſalvation upon man in that way, God is not bound to that Covenant, nor will ever ſave a Soul in the way of that Covenant. Now it is the work of the Spirit to diſcover this to a Soul, that this is not the way for me ever to attain ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it muſt be in another way and by another righteouſneſs, and hereby a ſoul is taken off from leaning and reſting upon its own righteouſneſs, and from ever looking for ſalvation by any thing it hath done or can do, though it ſhould do never ſo much; nay, and let me add this further, that when the Spirit of God doth thus take a ſoul off from leaning and reſting upon its own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet notwithſtanding the Spirit of the Lord doth put the Soul upon ſeeking and following hard after righteouſneſs and its own righteouſneſs too. Ay Brethren this is now a Goſpel-Myſtery that fleſh and blood can never attain to; for our
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:40096:102"/> carnal hearts are ready to argue thus, if we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaved by our own righteouſneſs, then we need not to follow after it, and ſo grow looſe and carnal and careleſs and ſlighty, neglecting duties, or elſe being formal in them. But now the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God doth teach the Soul and lead it in this middle way, in this ſtrait and narrow way; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul that the Spirit of God doth convince of righteouſneſs in order to ſalvation, he doth teach him, and inſtruct him in this, that though he ſhall never be ſaved by all that ever he can do, yet the Spirit leads him on in a way of holineſs and righteouſneſs, very exactly, to be careful to walk with God in obedience to the Lords will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. And the Holy Ghoſt doth write a Law of obedience upon the heart, and therefore thoſe that draw ſuch concluſions from this doctrine of the Goſpel, they do not underſtand the Goſpel, nor this convincing work of the Spirit, which is to convince us that we are not to look for ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by all our own righteouſneſs, and yet convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces us of the neceſſity of following hard after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. This now is the firſt thing that the Holy Ghoſt doth in convincing a ſoul of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to take the ſoul off from reſting and leaning upon its own righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But Secondly, Another thing that the Spirit doth in order to the convincing a ſoul of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is this, namely, <hi>The Spirit doth uſually diſcover to the Soul what this righteouſneſs of Chriſt is, by which it muſt look for acceptance with God to Salvation:</hi> The Spirit doth uſually reveal this righteouſneſs to the ſoul, therefore ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. <hi>The righteouſneſs of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:40096:103"/> from faith to faith,</hi> It is the work of the Spirit of God to reveal this righteouſneſs, to open it, and cauſe the Soul to underſtand it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spirit is called the Spirit of Revelation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17. The Apoſtle prays there, <hi>That God would give them the Spirit of Revelation, in the knowledge of Chriſt;</hi> becauſe it is the work of the Spirit to reveal the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt to the Soul, and cauſe the ſoul to underſtand it in ſome meaſure, but ſtill the ſoul is ſenſible of its own ignorance and blindneſs, and poſſibly more afterwards than before. But in ſome meaſure there is a diſcovery made of this righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt to the ſoul, and in order to this there are ſeveral things that the holy Spirit doth diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the Soul concerning this righteouſneſs of Chriſt, namely, It is the Spirit that diſcovers to the Soul the <hi>Perfection of this Righteouſneſs,</hi> that Chriſts righteouſneſs is a moſt perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat righteouſneſs, without any blemiſh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any defect or imperfection. The Spirit ſhews to the Soul that Chriſt hath fulfilled all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he was obedient to every tittle of the Law, there was no defect, no blemiſh at all in Chriſts life all along, neither in his outward nor inward man, from his very conception all along through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his life to his very death; the Spirit of the Lord doth make a ſoul to underſtand this in ſome meaſure, it diſcovers the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to be a perfect and compleat righteouſneſs; that though my own righteouſneſs be full of defects and imperfections, yet the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt is a perfect righteouſneſs. That is one thing that the Spirit uſally doth in this convincing
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:40096:103"/> of righteouſneſs, it diſcovers to the Soul that this righteouſneſs of Chriſt is a perfect and compleat righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>And not only ſo, but further, the Spirit diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to the ſoul that it is not only a perfect but an all-ſufficient righteouſneſs; the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt is not only a perfect righteouſneſs, exactly perfect to every tittle of the Law, but an all-ſufficient righteouſneſs; that the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt is able to ſave a World of ſinners, he was able by his righteouſneſs to be a propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the ſins of the whole World; 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>He is the Propitiation not for our ſins only, but for the ſins of the whole World;</hi> that is, for the ſins of all the Elect throughout the whole World, for all that were Chriſts ſeed, Chriſts poſterity; that now as all <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity were made ſinners by the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s unrighteouſneſs, ſo now Chriſts righteouſneſs is ſufficient to make all his poſterity, all his ſeed, to make them all righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in the ſight of God; becauſe now this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, it is the righteouſneſs of the Son of God, of that perſon that is the eternal Son of God, of that perſon that is very God equal with the Father, the ſame Eſſence with God. Now this is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God; as the Apoſtle calls the Blood that Chriſt ſhed, the Blood of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. So now this righteouſneſs of Chriſt is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of God, as it is uſually called in the New Teſtament, becauſe it is the righteouſneſs of that perſon which is God. Now this makes his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs to be an all-ſufficient righteouſneſs. Now then I may venture my Soul upon this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, if it be an all-ſufficient righteouneſs,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:40096:104"/> and the righteouſneſs of God, then it is ſuch a righteouſneſs as is ſufficient to ſave to the utmoſt all that come to God by him, and it is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting righteouſneſs, it will ſerve from the very beginning to the end of the World, to make poor unrighteous Creatures to become righteous in the ſight of God, and to be accepted of God to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life and ſalvation; nay; and then further, the Spirit of God goes on to diſcover and reveal this, namely, that God is ready to accept of this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in the behalf of poor ſinners, here is now the myſtery of the Goſpel, for truly this is a hard thing for fleſh and blood to be perſwaded of, that I can be made righteous with the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of another, that I can be fed with the meat that another eats, that I can be made warm by the cloaths that another wears, that I ſhould be made righteous with the perſonal righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt. Brethren, this is the work of the Spirit of God to diſcover and reveal this to the Soul, that God will accept of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt on the behalf of poor ſinners; <hi>He was made ſin for us that knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. Well, this, the Spirit of God doth diſcover and reveal to the Soul, when he comes to convince it of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Nay, and let me add further concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this righteouſneſs, namely, the Spirit doth diſcover to the Soul the way whereby he may come to have an intereſt in this righteouſneſs, the Spirit doth diſcover that to the Soul, namely, that it is in a way of faith, and believing, and leaning, and reſting upon the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, that <hi>Whoſoever believeth on him ſhall not
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:40096:104"/> periſh but have everlaſting life, and Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to every one that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi> Rom. 10.4. This is the work of the Spirit to diſcover this to the ſoul, when he comes to deal with the ſoul to convince it of righteouſneſs in order to ſalvation. This is the ſecond thing that the Spirit doth, firſt it takes us off from our own righteouſneſs, and then it reveals and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to the Soul this righteouſneſs of Chriſt, what it is, and which way it is to be attained. But then,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third Work that the Spirit doth, which is the upſhot of all, and that is this, when the Spirit comes to convince a Soul of righteouſneſs in order to ſalvation, then, <hi>The Spirit doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince powerfully and effectually,</hi> that is, <hi>the Spirit comes powerfully, and perſwades the Soul to cloſe with this righteouſneſs.</hi> This is to convince of righteouſneſs in order to ſalvation, ſo to convince as to perſwade and prevail with the ſoul to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to cloſe with it; this is the way whereby a Soul comes to have an intereſt in Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, by faith and believing on Chriſt, and it is the work of the Spirit ſo to convince, ſo powerfully ſo as to prevail with the Soul to give the venture: Well, I will venture my Soul upon it, if I periſh I periſh, I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture my Soul upon this righteouſneſs of Chriſt; the Spirit ſecretly perſwades the heart, ſo as now the Soul is made to ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 71.16. <hi>I will go in the ſtrength of the Lord God, I will make mention of thy righteouſneſs, even of thine only;</hi> When the Spirit comes thus to convince ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, ſo as to perſwade the Soul to venture to lean upon Chriſts righteouſneſs only to be accepted
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:40096:105"/> of God to ſalvation, then the ſoul doth make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts righteouſneſs, and that only: well, I will venture to reſt upon that alone, and then ſurely ſhall one ſay, <hi>In the Lord have I righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtrength,</hi> then the ſoul ſhall be made to ſay, there's all my righteouſneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have none of my own that I dare venture on, but I do now venture to lean the weight of my Soul upon this righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and if I periſh, I periſh. This is now the convincing work of the Spirit to convince of righteouſneſs. So now you have heard the point briefly opened, namely, <hi>That it is the Work of the Spirit in order to Salvation to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Soul of righteouſneſs.</hi> Now then briefly for the Application of it in a Word.</p>

                  <p>Here then we may come to underſtand whether or no the Spirit hath been at work upon our ſouls in order to ſalvation. It is a great Queſtion (I ſuppoſe you will think it ſo, when you come to ly upon your death-beds) whether or no the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God hath been at work upon my heart in order to my ſalvation? Well you ſee it is the work of the Spirit, in order to Salvation, to convince of ſin, and to convince of righteouſneſs; then conſider, I pray conſider ſeriouſly between the Lord and your own ſouls, and let us not willingly deceive our own ſouls, Hath the Spirit of the Lord ever been thus at work upon my heart? hath the Spirit ever come and convinced me of ſin, and of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs? For if the Spirit of the Lord hath ever convinced you of ſin in order to your Salvation, it will go on alſo in the Work of

                  <p>Well, a man or a woman may do all this, and yet come ſhort of this convincing work of the Spirit which is in order to Salvation. Therefore conſider further, I pray, for as you heard the laſt time, uſually when the Spirit doth convince of ſin in order to Salvation, it convinceth the ſoul eſpecially of unbelief; and indeed till a Soul come to be convinced by the Spirit of the ſin of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, his conviction of ſin may be no argument to him that the Spirit hath been at work upon his heart in order to ſalvation. Indeed when a ſoul comes to that diſcovery, that the ſoul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the evil of unbelief, then there is the greateſt hopes that ſuch a Soul is not like to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry; for I am perſwaded, that the Spirit of the Lord never convinces a Soul of the evil of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, but it is in order to his ſalvation; you ſhall never have a carnal heart to underſtand the evil of unbelief, that is the work of the Spirit of God. Now conſider, I pray, hath the Lord diſcovered

                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:40096:106"/>1. When the Spirit of the Lord doth convince a Soul of righteouſneſs in order to Salvation, it doth (as you heard) take a Soul clear off from its own righteouſneſs, and not only ſo, but it leads the Soul to follow after Righteouſneſs ſtill, after our own righteouſneſs too. This is the work of the Spirit, the Evangelical work of the Spirit to take a Soul off from its own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and cauſe it to lean only upon Chriſts righteouſneſs, and yet to follow hard after its own righteouſneſs; it is a myſtery to the World; ay, but the Spirit of the Lord doth lead a Soul in this way, whereas now one that hath but a notional conviction of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and that his own righteouſneſs cannot ſave him, alas! he will be ready to be formal and ſlighty in looking after his own righteouſneſs, he will be formal and careleſs in duties and ordinances, — or elſe he will be ready to neglect them; he thinks under a notion of Chriſts righteouſneſs, that he ſhall be ſaved by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and ſo he neglects following hard after his own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Brethren, this is that the Spirit of the Lord doth, when he convinces a Soul of the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt in order to Salvation, it ſtill cauſes the Soul to follow hard after its own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though not to be accepted of God for it, not to be ſaved by it, but for ſuch ends as I told you of before. This is the way now that the Spirit of the Lord doth work upon the Soul in, in order to its ſalvation. And then</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, this alſo the Spirit is wont to do, when he convinces of righteouſneſs, he doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince effectually and powerfully, (as I told you)
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:40096:107"/> he doth ſo convince the ſoul of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, as to perſwade the ſoul to venture to lean its everlaſting condition upon it, to lean there, to reſt there; I ſay, this is the work of the Spirit. And let us conſider with our ſelves, I pray, whether the Spirit hath been thus at work upon our hearts in order to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Well, to conclude and take my Farewel of you; As we deſire to obtain life and ſalvation through the righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, take but only theſe three words which I ſhall leave with you and ſo have done.

Chriſt ſpake plain enough, if they had not been maliciouſly blind, <hi>Yet a little while</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and</hi> I <hi>go to him that ſent me,</hi> and ſo they made a meer mock. So that here we may take notice, that, <hi>Malicious minded men in ſtead of receiving any Word of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and advice, will be ready rather to rail, mock, and ſcoff at them who give it.</hi> And ſo here to the Jews it was a word of Admonition that Chriſt gave, but they fell a mocking and ſcoffing at him; And ſo it was of old, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.20. you read there, how King <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> ſent about Prieſts and Levites throughout the Cities, out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to their Souls, to teach the Word among them, and to put them in mind of their duty, and it is ſaid, they mocked thoſe that came, they mocked the meſſengers of the Lord, for the words which they brought were for the welfare of their Souls. And ſo you read concerning the Lords Prophets that he ſent to <hi>Juda,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. It's ſaid, <hi>They mocked at the Lords Meſſengers till there was no remedy.</hi> And ſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. <hi>Paul</hi> was preaching of the reſurrection of the dead, and 'tis ſaid they mocked, <hi>Many mocked and ſcoffed at him,</hi> v. 32. <hi>And when they heard of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, ſome mocked, and others ſaid, We will hear thee again concerning this matter.</hi> And thus it hath been, and ſo I ſay, as <hi>Paul</hi> in the <hi>Galatians, Even ſo it is now, and ſo it will be.</hi> And it may be of ſupport unto the Servants of God that give words of Admonition, Reproof,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:40096:109"/> and Reprehenſion, Let them be ſatisfied in this, that though they be mocked, 'tis no more than was the Lot of the Servants of God of old before them. Well, but mark now how Chriſt doth go on for all this, he was not diſcouraged, he doth not turn his back upon them, becauſe they mocked and ſcoffed and jeered him, but mark he goes into the Temple, and falls a preaching graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Words unto them, as in the Text; <hi>In the laſt day, that great day of the Feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink.</hi> Here was the Sermon that he preached after that deriſion that he met with from the Jews; I ſay, the words that I have read are the Sermon that Chriſt had preached in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as you may ſee recorded by the Evangeliſt. Concerning this Sermon take notice of two or three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt of all,</hi> Here is ſet forth <hi>the Time,</hi> when it was that Chriſt preached this Sermon: It's ſaid, <hi>the laſt Day, that great Day of the Feaſt,</hi> what Feaſt? why the Feaſt of Tabernacles, that Chriſt did preach this Sermon, and 'tis ſaid the <hi>laſt Day, and great Day of the Feaſt.</hi> Obſerve it, the Feaſt of Tabernacles was not kept only one day, but many days, even ſeven days together. <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.34. <hi>And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes, ſaying, Speak unto the Children of Iſrael, the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the ſeventh Month ſhall be the Feaſt of Tabernacles for ſeven days unto the Lord,</hi> the fifteenth day of the ſeventh Month, that is our <hi>September.</hi> Now for theſe ſeven days, the firſt and the laſt were kept in a ſolemn manner; in the other days they did ſervile work, but not on the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:40096:110"/> firſt and laſt day, and ſo in <hi>Nehemia</hi>'s time, they kept the laſt day of the Feaſt very ſolemnly, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.18. <hi>And they kept the Feaſt ſeven days, and on the eighth day was a ſolemn aſſembly, according unto the manner.</hi> The laſt day, then the people came generally into the Temple to hear the law read unto them, and therefore that laſt day was called the great day of the Feaſt, for the people on the morrow were to depart into all parts of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as they came from all parts; ſo here, on the laſt day, on the great day of the Feaſt, Chriſt preached unto them on this ſubject.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis ſet forth by the <hi>Manner of it,</hi> in what manner Chriſt did preach this Sermon to them, There is a double circumſtance in the preaching of this Sermon; It's ſaid Chriſt ſtood, but ordinarily Chriſt is ſaid to ſit down; As he ſat down in the ſhip, but here 'tis ſaid he ſtood, that he might be better heard and ſeen of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. And another thing about the manner of it, is, He ſtood and cried with a mighty voice, he did <hi>extend his voice,</hi> ſo as all might hear, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great concourſe of people, and likewiſe intimating that he was not afraid of the people; he goes up into the Temple, and there he cries it, intimating alſo that the matter was a weighty matter, which he had then to ſpeak unto them, as if he had ſaid, now take this word with you, 'tis a matter of great concernment. And that is the third thing here in the Text.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The matter of his Sermon when he ſtood and cried ſo, what did he ſpeak or ſay? why, this it was, <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me, and drink.</hi> This was the ſum of his
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:40096:110" rendition="simple:additions"/> Sermon that he ſtood up and cried or preached unto the people. Wherein we have theſe two Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A gracious Invitation to all that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſt.</hi> And</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>A gracious Promiſe,</hi> that if they did come, they ſhould drink. The Rabbies amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> recorded of this Feaſt, that in this laſt day, they were wont to go and powre abundance of water and wine (in a way of rejoycing) upon the Altar, and therefore Chriſt in alluſion to that (ſpeaking to them) ſaith, <hi>If any man be athirſt, let him come unto me, and drink.</hi> Briefly to take up what I conceive to be Chriſts meaning in this place. There is a great deal of the Goſpel here in theſe Words, in this general Proclamation, <hi>If any man be athirſt, let him come to me and drink.</hi> Then know,</p>

               <p>Whoever being athirſt doth come to Chriſt, he ſhall have a ſupply, he ſhall have a full ſupply, he ſhall not only taſt or ſip, but drink a full draught, his belly full, ſo filled, that as the Word ſaith, <hi>Out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water;</hi> and not only ſo, but he ſhall have a full ſupply moſt freely, drink moſt freely he doth not deſire money or price, but according to that Proclamation which you have to this purpoſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho every one

Briefly to open the point, and ſhew,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>What manner of Thirſt it is that Chriſt ſpeaks off,</hi> What thirſt is it?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>What is that ſame coming?</hi> Or how may a man that is athirſt, how may ſuch an one come? you will ſay, ſuppoſe it be a thirſt after the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life, how may I come, or in what way may I come to Chriſt? And then</p>
               <p n="3">3. Shew you, <hi>That thoſe who being thirſty do come to Chriſt, they ſhall certainly be ſupplyed to the full,</hi> They ſhall have drink given them freely, moſt freely. I ſhall deſire to have reſpect to the ſeaſon and apply my ſelf accordingly to ſhew you what we are to underſtand by this ſame thirſt, <hi>If any man be a thirſt let him come and drink,</hi> What manner of thirſt is it?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We are not here to underſtand it to be a bodily
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:40096:111"/> thirſt,</hi> but we are to underſtand it of ſpiritual thirſt, a thirſting of the Soul, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>My Soul thirſteth for thee O God, for the Living God,</hi> Pſal. 42.2. There's a thirſt of the Soul, as well as a thirſt of the Body, and the thirſt of the Soul is ſet forth by the ſimilitude or reſemblance of the Body, and ſo by what this thirſt of the body is, we may the better underſtand the reſemblance of the thirſt of the Soul. There are three things in a bodily thirſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a ſenſe that the body feels of want, there is not only a want of moiſture but the body is ſenſible of it, it is ſuch a want as is an afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive want, in the want of it the body ſtands in need of a ſupply, and ſo you may read concerning <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> the water being out, ſhe did not know what to do for water, and away ſhe goes crying for her child, and her child cries too, and ſo even ready to periſh for want of water. And ſo <hi>Sampſon,</hi> after he had made a great ſlaughter of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>What ſhall this victory do me good, if I want water?</hi> ſo that it is the ſenſe of the want of ſomething that is needful, and as there is a ſenſe of ſomething, ſo an ardent and vehement deſire, and longing after the fulfilling of that deſire, as you read of <hi>Siſera, Judg.</hi> 4. That great General begged a draught of water being very thirſty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the thirſt of the body, there are not only longing deſires, vehement earneſt deſires for a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but it is altogether unſatisfied, till it hath ſome thing of water or moiſture to ſupply it's thirſt. As the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> they muſt have water whatever comes of it, they muſt have water, and <hi>Moſes</hi> ſmites the rock, and fetcht water out of it for them. Why</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:40096:112"/>1. <hi>Firſt of all,</hi> In the thirſt of the ſoul, the ſoul is ſenſible of the want of ſome ſpiritual good thing, he is not only wanting it, and without it, but he is ſenſible of it: In this thirſt of the ſoul, there is a deep ſenſe of the want of ſome ſpiritual good thing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.1.2.3. <hi>David</hi> being baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Tabernacle, from the publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, O! ſaith he, <hi>My Soul thirſteth for God;</hi> He wanted the Ordinances, as he uſed to have had them, <hi>that I may ſee thy glory in thy San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary.</hi> In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.17. <hi>When the poor and needy ſeek water, and there is none, and their tongue faileth for thirſt</hi> (a gracious promiſe) ſee what want there is, when the Soul is in ſuch a caſe, being ſo ſenſible that it is even faint and failing, <hi>I the Lord will hear them, I the God of Iſrael will not forſake them.</hi> And then again,</p>
               <p n="3">3. As with the body when it's athirſt, it doth vehemently and ſtrongly deſire; ſo now in this ſame thirſt of the ſoul there is an ardent, an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ſtrong deſire after that which it finds it ſtands in need of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.1.2. <hi>David</hi> doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the thirſt of his ſoul, as the Hart that is wearied, and tyred, and juſt ſpent in hunting: O it longs and thirſts after the water brooks for its refreſhment, <hi>ſo doth my Soul after thee O God; O when ſhall I come and appear before God!</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.8. <hi>My Soul followeth hard after God,</hi> it was when his ſoul was thirſty; in the beginning of the Pſalm his ſoul was thirſty for God, and <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>My Soul followeth hard after God,</hi> more than a man that is athirſt follows hard for the ſatisfying his deſire of thirſt. So when the Soul that hath wanted ſome ſpiritual good thing (being athirſt)
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:40096:112"/> hath longed vehemently, and ſtrongly, and been very earneſt for it. And then again</p>
               <p n="3">3. When the ſoul is ſpiritually thirſty, it is not ſatisfied with any thing ſhort of that which it finds it ſtands in need of, of that ſpiritual good thing, of that ſpiritual mercy; As <hi>Abraham,</hi> he was athirſt, his ſoul was athirſt for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the Promiſe; well, <hi>Abraham</hi> goes a long while before the accompliſhment of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, twenty years or better, and in the mean while God gives <hi>Abraham</hi> other Promiſes, but yet he is not ſatisfied; ſaith God to <hi>Abraham, Behold Abraham, I am thy ſhield, and thine exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great reward;</hi> what could <hi>Abraham</hi> deſire more than God to be his great reward, even all; and yet ſaith <hi>Abraham, Lord, what wilt thou give me? and I go childleſs;</hi> nothing elſe but what God promiſed him will ſatisfy him. When the ſoul is athirſt, nothing will ſatisfy but what it is a thirſting after: One thing have I deſired, and that will I ſeek, it is that which I have thirſted after, and longed for, and nothing ſhall ſatisfy me till I have my longing; I have made it the main of my deſires, and I will ſtill deſire it, even as the Woman of <hi>Canaan;</hi> ſhe deſired mercy for her Daughter that was poſſeſſed of a Devil, ſhe had other mercies, yet ſhe would not be ſatisfied without ſhe had that mercy. And this is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a thirſt; Why now ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If any be a thirſt, let him come to me.</hi>

                  <p>It is true indeed, it's not here expreſt for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a man doth thirſt, I ſuppoſe Chriſt doth not mean whoſoever thirſts for the World, or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Comforts, or for ſpiritual gifts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ends, but Chriſt means ſuch mercies and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings as do accompany and neceſſarily tend to the ſalvation of the ſoul; if any man thirſt for ſuch a mercy, for that which he calls in the next verſe, <hi>the Water of Life, Out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water,</hi> who thirſts ſo; and he doth more plainly expreſs it, <hi>Verſe</hi> 39. This he ſpake of the Spirit, <hi>Out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living Water,</hi> that is, whoſoever is athirſt for ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual mercies, whoſoever is athirſt for ſaving ſanctifying grace, he that is athirſt for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Spirit, for the ſaving graces thereof, as faith, meekneſs, humility, and patience, as the Apoſtle reckons divers fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Galat.</hi> 5.22, 23. Whoſoever doth long, and is ſenſible of the want of theſe ſaving bleſſings, and mercies, pardon of ſin, and aſſurance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:40096:113"/> whoſoever is ſenſible of theſe wants, and longs for a ſupply of them, and is unſatisfied without them; Whoſoever he is that is thus, <hi>Let him come to me.</hi> Now, I ſay, this ſame ſpiritual thirſt of the Soul is very neceſſary, elſe the Soul will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ever come to Chriſt for to be ſupplyed: Like as it is with a man that hath no ailment at all, at leſt no ſence of it, tell him of a Phyſician, he will not ſtir a ſtep after him for cure: Thoſe that are truly thirſty, and have not wherewithal to ſupply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they are they that will come to Chriſt. And hence it is that when Chriſt would ſtir up thoſe of <hi>Laodicea</hi> to come unto him, he doth it by ſhewing them their ſpiritual wants; <hi>Thou ſaiſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that thou ſtandeſt in need of nothing, that thou art full and ſtandeſt in need of nothing; But I ſay,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that thou art blind, miſerable and naked.</hi> Firſt Chriſt doth convince them (as it were) of their need of a thirſt, and then holds forth the Water of Life. Here's the firſt thing opened. What we are to underſtand by this thirſt. They who are truly thirſty, let them come to Chriſt: But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What is this coming to Chriſt, or how may the Soul come unto Chriſt, to drink of the water of life? As I ſaid before concerning thirſt, 'tis not a thirſt of the body, but a thirſt of the ſoul: In what way may the Soul be ſaid to come unto Chriſt? Briefly three ways the Soul that is athirſt may be ſaid to come to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, <hi>We are to come to Chriſt in the way of his Ordinances,</hi> attending upon his Word, to hearken to Chriſt there; Let him come to me in the way of mine Ordinances; As in Scripture
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:40096:114"/> phraſe, in that place before mentioned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.2, 3. Coming is an hearkening diligently, enclining the ear; Come unto me by enclining of your ear; Jeſus Chriſt is uſually to be found in his own way in his ordinances, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Lo I am with you alway, even to the end of the World,</hi> yea in his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, in the adminiſtration of the Goſpel, I am with you. Then come to the place where Chriſt is, or where he may meet with you. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived you the Spirit by the hearing of the Law, or by the preaching, of Faith?</hi> that is the Goſpel; <hi>Ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, by having the Goſpel preached;</hi> he compares the preaching of the Law, and the preaching of the Goſpel, and calls the preaching of the Law the Letter, and the preaching of the Goſpel the Spirit. To come to Chriſt, to wait upon Chriſt in his own way, where he gives out this water of life; he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives of this water of life, muſt be found in the way where Chriſt comes, as <hi>Zaccheus</hi> was, when Chriſt ſaid to him, <hi>this day is Salvation come to thy houſe.</hi> This was beyond his deſire, and beyond his thirſt: Would you come to Chriſt, come into his Galleries, come into my ſiſter, my Spouſe. Would you come to Chriſt? come where he is, and ſee, he walks in the midſt of his golden Candleſticks, there wait upon him in the way of his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and here what he will ſay unto you for a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of your wants.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Come unto Chriſt in a way of Ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> by asking of him the waters of life, So we are to come, and this is called a coming to the Lord in the <hi>Hebrews, He that cometh to God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:40096:114"/> that diligently ſeek him, Chap.</hi> 11.6. He that comes to God, how? in a way of prayer, and ſo to ſeek grace to help in a time of need; come in a way of prayer. And ſee how he directed the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> Chriſt asked her a little water, and ſhe denyed him, well ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If thou hadſt asked of me, I would have given thee living water,</hi> how would he have given her living water? why in a way of asking.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirldy, <hi>We are to come in a way of Faith,</hi> And ſo ſaith Chriſt here in this Text, <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come and drink,</hi> that is, he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in me, and ſo this coming to Chriſt is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to be believing, <hi>John</hi> 6.35. <hi>He that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth unto me ſhall never hunger, and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in me ſhall never thirſt.</hi> Look now as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing is a departing from the Lord, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38.39. <hi>Take heed, if any man draw back, my Soul ſhall have no pleaſure in him; But we are not of thoſe that draw back, but of them that believe to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Soul.</hi> O! an evil heart of unbelief is a departing from God; and ſo then by believing, the ſoul is ſaid to come to God, to draw neer to God. But what is that coming unto Chriſt, or believing in Chriſt, whereby the Soul ſhall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſatisfied? is it a believing that Jeſus Chriſt is the Meſſias, the Saviour of the World? the very Devils do believe this; No, but briefly, This Believing is, namely, <hi>The Souls reſt, and relying, and truſting upon Chriſt for acceptance in the ſight of God, for remiſſion of ſins, for Salvation, and eternal life.</hi> Truſting and relying upon Chriſt and his merits for Salvation, a putting confidence in the Lord. Now when the Soul doth rely and
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:40096:115"/> venture through a Word of invitation in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, through Chriſts invitation doth adventure to rely upon his merits, to be wholly accepted in the ſight of God. This now is a coming to Chriſt. And now ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If any man thirſt, Let him c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me unto me and he ſhall drink.</hi> Let not any here move contention, and ſay, what do you bid us come to Chriſt, why this holds forth free Will? Why, know that ſuch exhortations uſually and frequently are in all the duties, that the Holy Ghoſt requires of us, which he knows we have no ſtrength to do; the Lord calls us to pray, and 'tis our duty ſo to do; and to believe, but we have no ſtrength and power of our ſelves, but we muſt not ſtand upon cavelling and ſay, 'tis but a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for us to be ſtriving, ſeeing we can do nothing, but it is our duty to be doing what lies in us to the performance, and wait upon the Lord for his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in with power to enable us to perform; as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he was in the grave, Chriſt called and with his word power was given forth, and he came out. So now we ſhould indeavour to rely and truſt upon Chriſt in his grace, and in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to have a ſupply of this ſame Water of life, and not to give over and cavil. That is a third, to ſhew what way the Soul that is truly a thirſt ſhould come to Chriſt. Then</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>Such as being athirſt and do come to Chriſt, they ſhall certainly be ſupplyed,</hi> They ſhall certainly have a full ſupply, and it freely given them, for ſo ſaith Chriſt, <hi>If any man thirſt let him come and he ſhall drink freely;</hi> He doth not expect any thing, or hold forth any price, but they, whoever come, ſhall drink freely, they
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:40096:115"/> ſhall certainly have a full ſupply, and be ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed freely; and he ſpeaking it, ſpake in the hearing and audience of many thouſands. I ſhall ſpeak a Word of Application.</p>

                     <hi>This may help us to diſcern, whether we have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been made to drink out of the Well of Salvation.</hi> Whether ever we have been made to drink of the waters which Jeſus Chriſt hath given forth: and to go no further than the Text, there are two things that may help us to diſcern it, and one is this.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That if ever the Soul hath drank of the waters of life that are held forth, then it was once athirſt for Chriſt; for here the offer that Chriſt makes is to thirſty ſouls, and thoſe who thirſt not will not care for coming. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Not only thirſty, but they muſt alſo come to Chriſt. And therefore briefly to hint what I have ſpoken before.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Conſider whether you have been truly thirſty,</hi> and by that you may ſee and know whether you have truly drank of this water of life. Conſider it every one, hath my ſoul been truly thirſty? the ſoul that is truly thirſty is really ſenſible of ſome ſpiritual want, that he wants ſome ſpiritual mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſo ſenſible as to be ſpiritually affected, yea afflicted with the ſenſe of it: As a man that is thirſty for water, he is ſo ſenſible that if he have it not he is afflicted for it; why ſo, let every ſoul conſider, well, hath my ſoul ever been really ſenſible of the want of ſome ſaving mercy, or
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:40096:116"/> truth? hath my ſoul been ever ſenſible of it? I pray conſider it with your own ſouls, what ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace is it that your ſouls have been ſenſible for the want of? even afflicted for the want of it? if ever you have been very greatly thirſty in your bodies, you have been very ſenſible. I pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, can you remember that ever your ſouls were really ſenſible ſo as to be afflicted for the want of ſome ſpiritual ſaving mercy from God?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, <hi>Conſider, If you have been thirſty, Whether you have ever found that ſame ſtrong ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and longing deſire after a ſupply of that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual want you are in?</hi> As pardon of ſin, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace: Have your ſouls not only been affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but afflicted from the ſence of the want of Grace, being ardently, vehemently, and earneſtly longing after it: Can you remember at ſuch a time your body was thirſty, and you longed for water, and could have drank puddle water by a good token, and cannot you remember that your ſouls have been longing, vehemently longing, moſt earneſtly longing after, and panting after this ſpiritual water of life, and to have been alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unſatisfied, without you might have that ſpiritual grace and mercy, which you have longed for: If a man be thirſty, he will not be ſatisfied with a ſong, you may ſing him a ſong, but that will not ſatisfy him, and give him what you will he muſt have that which he longs for, and that which he deſires, or nothing. And hath it been thus with your ſouls? conſider what I ſay; can you ſay, you have longed for this grace and the other, for ſaving grace and the like, well, but have you not been ſatisfied with ſomething elſe?
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:40096:116"/> for I ſay, if we had not had in ſome meaſure a ſupply, our ſouls would ſtill have been thirſty, and never ſatisfied without that we have found a need of. And then take that along with all, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Conſider whether ever you have truly come to Chriſt.</hi> Suppoſe you have longed for this and that mercy, and have been unſatisfied for want of this mercy, conſider of it, did you ever truly come to Chriſt? have you ever been athirſt? have you ever come to Chriſt in his Ordinances for a ſupply? why, yes you will ſay, you have come to the Ordinances to hear the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Ay Brethren, you may come to hear, and yet not come to Chriſt; have you ever come to hear the Word from the ſenſe of the want of ſome ſpiritual ſaving grace, that he would ſupply to you? it is ordinary for every one to come, except they are ſuch as are deſperately wicked and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, but thus we are to come, and have we ever come thus to Chriſt? even as the Saints have been wont to come to the Ordinances, with a ſenſe of their ſpiritual wants, <hi>I will hearken and hear what God the Lord will ſpeak to me, for he will ſpeak peace:</hi> He wanted peace, and he had the ſenſe of the want of peace upon him, now ſaith he, God will ſpeak peace. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. The good man was under a great temptation, and it was even too hard for him, and he was even ready to cry out of the temptation, and murmur, and repine againſt God, well he now goes unto the Lord in the way of his Ordinances, and hearkens what God will give unto him, to anſwer his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and then his temptation was anſwered
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:40096:117"/> in his waiting upon God in the ſenſe of his ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al wants for a ſupply. And ſo have you even come thus to the Lord in the way of his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? when you came this day before the Lord, can you ſay (between the Lord and your own Souls) that you came upon the ſenſe of ſome ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual want for your Souls unto the Lord in this Ordinance? Why Brethren, it is a rare thing for to come to Chriſt in the way of his Ordinances, in the ſenſe of the want of ſome ſpiritual mercy. But,</p>
                  <p n="4">4: Again, Conſider, <hi>Have you ever come to Chriſt in a way of prayer?</hi> to ask a ſpiritual mercy and bleſſing. It's true inded, you will ſay, you go to God every day for the pardon of ſin, and aſſurance of it; you go every day, but now have you come to the Lord and asked this ſpiritual mercy, and the other, as a thirſty man that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ready to periſh for want of drink, and to take nothing in a way of ſatisfaction (whatſoever you have beſides) without you have that you are ſo ſenſible of.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And then, Conſider, <hi>Whether you have ever come to Chriſt in a way of Faith.</hi> There is the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Chriſt indeed, if ever you would drink of the water of life, you muſt come in a way of faith. Though you have come to the Word, and come in a way of prayer, yet have you come in a way of faith? relying, and reſting, and rolling upon Chriſt in a way of Faith, to be accepted of the Father through him, and ſo for remiſſion of ſins, and whatever ſaving benefit you ſtand in need of. Have you ever came to Chriſt thus? relying upon him in his word, in the invitation he makes there,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:40096:117"/> and in his promiſe? this is the way to come to Chriſt; <hi>He that believeth on me, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water.</hi> Let us conſider of it between the Lord and our own ſouls, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever we have come to Chriſt and ſo drank of the waters of life? if we have not been thirſty, though we may have ſeemed to be ſo, yet if we have not really come to Chriſt, we fall ſhort of what we might have expected to have met with.</p>
                  <p>I thought to have preſt the invitation on poor ſouls, that they might come and drink of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life, but the time is paſt.</p>

                     <bibl>
                        <hi>JOHN 7.37.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                     <p>In the laſt day, that great day of the Feaſt, Jeſus ſtood, and cried, ſaying; If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink.</p>
                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THE Point or Truth that was before us from theſe words was this; namely,
<q>That ſuch as being thirſty, and come unto Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall certainly have a full and free ſupply.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Or, as you may take it in the words of Chriſt, <hi>If any man be a thirſt, let him come to</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>and drink.</hi> This Jeſus Chriſt did ſpeak, and cryed it in the hearing of many thouſands, ſaying, <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have heard what it is to thirſt, and what this thirſt is, it is a thirſt of the ſoul which Jeſus Chriſt here ſpeaks of, <hi>If any man thirſt,</hi> it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes theſe three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is a ſence, even an afflictive ſence of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:40096:118"/> ſomething that it ſees a neceſſity of: As it is with the thirſt of the Body, if one be truly thirſty he doth not only want water, or want drink or moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, but is ſenſible of it, and is afflicted with the ſenſe of it. So now, this ſame thirſty ſoul it hath a ſence of ſpiritual want, and is afflicted with the ſenſe of it. You may ſee <hi>David</hi> cryes out ſaying, <hi>I am in a place where no water is.</hi> And, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63. <hi>My ſoul thirſteth for God.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>The needy ſeek water, and their tongue fails for thirſt.</hi> There is an afflictive ſenſe upon the ſoul from the want of ſome ſpiritual good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is not only a ſenſe of want, but there is alſo an ardent and vehement deſire of a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. And,</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Soul is not only lodging and deſiring, but is unſatisfied with any thing ſhort of that it deſires.</p>
               <p>Several other particulars were inſiſted upon, and I came to a third, which now I ſhall deſire to ſpeak to through the Lords aſſiſtance. <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  <q>That ſuch as do come to Chriſt ſhall have a full ſupply.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Every ſoul that doth come to Chriſt ſhall be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; He that comes to me, ſhall not only have a taſte, but ſhall have a full ſupply; <hi>Let him come unto me and drink;</hi> He ſhall not only have a full ſuyply but a free ſupply; Chriſt doth not require any thing at all, Whoſoever he be that comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, he ſhall drink, he ſhall be freely ſupplyed. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Let him that is a thirſt, come: And whoſoever will, let him come, and take of the waters
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:40096:119"/> of Life freely.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho every one that is a thirſt come ye, to the Waters:</hi> He ſhall be made to drink, and be ſupplied with all ſpiritual, heavenly, and eternall Bleſſings. Jeſus Chriſt he is a full ſupply, and though we may have a Notion that in Jeſus Chriſt there is a full ſupply, yet we have a Principle and Notion in us, that we have ſome ſupply in our ſelves; A Popiſh Principle, Chriſt may ſupply us in part, but ſome from our ſelves; and therefore we have a Notion, as if we ſhould go unto Chriſt with money in our hands, to buy it of him. Therefore a little to clear theſe things, <hi>viz.</hi> To demonſtrate,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Jeſus Chriſt will certainly give a full ſupply.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there is a full ſupply that Chriſt will give out, not a part only, but a full ſupply to all that come to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt will give out a full ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of all ſpiritual Bleſſings: Whatſoever good things the ſoul can ſtand in need of, or can poſſibly deſire; Jeſus Chriſt will give out a full ſupply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all them, even every of them that comes to him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Demonſtration is taken from <hi>The Incomprehenſible Fullneſs that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He is a full Fountain, not as a Pail or a Bucket drawn from a Well, but he is a full Fountain; now from out of a fountain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>here is a full ſupply to be had, a man may drink as much as ever he will, as much as ever he can hold; Now Chriſt is a full Fountain, ſee what is ſaid concerning Chriſt, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.1. <hi>In that day, there ſhall be a Fountain ſet open to the houſe of David, and to the Inhabitants
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:40096:119"/> of Jeruſalem, for ſin and for uncleanneſs.</hi> And ſo, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. <hi>It pleaſed the Father, that in him all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould dwell, even all fulneſs:</hi> Now if Chriſt be a fountain, a full fountain, there is fulneſs of ſupply to be had in him: Now all fulneſs of bleſſings are in Jeſus Chriſt, he is a fountain of all ſpiritual things that are needful for the ſalvation of a poor ſoul, and there is a fulneſs of Spirit in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3.34. <hi>For God giveth not the Spirit by meaſure to him,</hi> And ſo <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2.9. 'tis ſaid, <hi>It pleaſed the Father that the fulneſs of the God-head dwelt in him as Mediator,</hi> the fulneſs of the Deity, the fulneſs of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And then, as there is a fulneſs of the God-head dwelling in him as Mediator, and a fulneſs of the Spirit, ſo there is alſo a <hi>Fulneſs of all gifts, and of all graces in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> John 1.14. <hi>He is the only begotten Son of the Father full of Grace and Truth.</hi> And ſo in him are hid the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge, they are all hid in Chriſt, he is the fountain of them; and the Apoſtle hath another full expreſſion <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.8. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto me who am leſs than the leaſt of all Saints is this grace given, that I ſhould preach among the Gentiles the unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches of Chriſt:</hi> Unſearchable riches that can never be drawn dry. The fulneſs of the Spirit, the fulneſs of all Grace dwelleth in him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, There is a <hi>Fulneſs of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Satisfaction in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo as to make a poor ſinner to be accepted as righteous before God, and diſcharge it of all ſins, as the Angel told <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 9.24. <hi>To make an end of Sins, and to bring in an everlaſting Righteouſneſs,</hi> a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:40096:120"/> that will ſerve to all eternity for all, from the beginning to the end of the World; and though the Saints are ſtriving after a meaſure and fulneſs daily, yet notwithſtanding there is a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Jeſus Chriſt, the blood of Jeſus cleanſeth from all ſin, there is merit enough, and vertue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. 1 <hi>John.</hi> 2.5. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and he is the Propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but for the ſins of the whole World.</hi> There's righteouſneſs, and ſatisfaction, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit enough for all. And</p>
               <p n="4">4, Then there is a <hi>Fulneſs of power to give out, and to communicate unto others.</hi> See <hi>John</hi> 5.26, 27. <hi>For as the Father hath Life in himſelf, ſo hath he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Son to have Life in himſelf, and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him authority to execute Judgment alſo, becauſe he is the Son of man.</hi> As the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo there is fulneſs of power and authority given out unto Jeſus Chriſt, to give out to whom he will, and he gives and communicates as being full of the Spirit.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>He communicates of the Spirit and Holy Ghoſt to whom he will,</hi> He gives the Spirit, and therefore promiſes it to his Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 16.7. When they heard of his departure from them, that night he ſhould be betrayed, Chriſt having given them a hint of it, they were troubled, and ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Becauſe I tell you the truth you are grieved, yet nevertheleſs it is expedient for you that I go away,</hi> and that you be deprived of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>for when I go away, I will ſend the Holy Ghoſt, the Comforter unto you.</hi> And ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter Acts</hi> 2. When the Holy Ghoſt fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:40096:120"/> the twelve with fiery tongues, the people mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled at it, and thought they were drunk with new wine, no ſaith <hi>Peter, Theſe are not drunken with new wine,</hi> as you ſuppoſe, <hi>this is an effect of the Promiſe as to the latter days, according to Joels Prophecy.</hi> And</p>
               <p n="2">2. Again, <hi>He communicates of the Gifts and Graces of the Spirit.</hi> The Graces of the Spirit are given out by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. <hi>When he aſcended on high, he led Captivity Captive, and gave Gifts unto men,</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Grace and Peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He giveth Gifts and Graces.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And ſo again, <hi>Chriſt doth communicate and give out Forgiveneſs and Remiſſion of Sin.</hi> He hath power and authority to give out that, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. When they brought the Palſey man, and Chriſt ſaw their faith, ſaith he, <hi>Son be of good chear, thy ſins are forgiven thee,</hi> and certain of them thought he had blaſphemed, well ſaith he, <hi>That I may ſhew unto you, that I have power on earth to forgive ſins, I ſay unto thee, Son, take up thy bed and walk.</hi> And ſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his own right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give unto Iſrael repentance and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins.</hi> And</p>
               <p n="4">4. Again, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt doth communicate Peace and Conſolation,</hi> Peace with God, and true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And ſo in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother place, <hi>If there be any conſolation in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> — taking it for granted there is conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Jeſus Chriſt, and all true conſolation comes
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:40096:121"/> from him. And ſo as our ſufferings abound, ſo do our conſolations abound much more through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Again</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>It is Jeſus Chriſt alſo that doth communicate and give out eternal life,</hi> to whom he will: Saith he, <hi>My ſheep hear my voice and they follow me, and I give them eternal life.</hi> Brethren, Chriſt hath power and authority to give out all ſpiritual bleſſings, a fountain having all fulneſs, ſo they that come to Chriſt for a ſupply come to a full fountain. Brethren, if ſo be that Jeſus Chriſt were full of the Spirit, and full of grace, — yet if he were not full as a fountain, he could not communicate; look now, as it is with a bucket, though it may be full of water, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it hath not the fulneſs of a fountain, as it doth ſupply any it hath ſo much the leſs, but Chriſt now being a fountain-fulneſs, though he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate never ſo much, yet ſtill there is the ſame ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as now go to the ſea, all the rivers in the World are filled with the ſea, and yet the ſea hath never a whit the leſs; and ſo the Sun hath given out its light day by day, four thouſand years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and yet the Sun hath never the leſs light in it, becauſe it is the fountain of light; So Chriſt, (now) being a fountain hath never the leſs in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, ſtill as much grace, as much holineſs, as much righteouſneſs as before. And ſo the Saints ſome of them have been full of the Holy Ghoſt (as <hi>Stephen</hi>) though yet notwithſtanding, their fulneſs is not the fulneſs of a fountain, and ſo they cannot ſupply the want of others; As the wiſe Virgins, when the fooliſh Virgins wanted Oyl and their lamps were out, they would have
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:40096:121"/> had oyl of the wiſe, but ſay they, we have none to ſpare, none to communicate, why? becauſe they have not a fountain. But ſtill now in Jeſus Chriſt there is a fulneſs, as a fountain of all grace whatſoever. That is the firſt Demonſtration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Take another withall, and that is this, to ſhew that there is a full ſupply in him, becauſe, <hi>All that come to Jeſus Chriſt are neer to him, nay they are united to him,</hi> They are made neer unto God, being united unto Chriſt, and thereupon they have a communication of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from Union, for Union is the cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication; as now if the Branches of a Tree be united to the tree, they communicate and partake of the trees root, ſap, and nature of it; Saith Chriſt, <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the Branches,</hi> why now the branches of the Vine partake of the Vine; look now as it is with the members of the natural body, being joyned, they do communicate and participate with all the members; as the Head, it is the ſeat of all the ſenſitive or animal Spirits, and the head being united to the body, there is a communication of all the ſenſes, from the head to every member according to its capacity, why now, Jeſus Chriſt, he is the head, we are his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, fleſh of his fleſh, bone of his bone, we are members of him being joyned to him, and they that are joyned to the Lord are one Spirit, we are by faith joyned to the Lord, and Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to dwell in us by faith; there is a nearer union that the believing ſoul hath with Jeſus Chriſt, than any member hath to the natural bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, than any branch hath to a natural tree, yea, than our ſouls and bodies have to each other,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:40096:122"/> 
                  <hi>John</hi> 6.56. <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> Now the nearer we be to a fountain, the nearer a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſuppoſe one were in a fountain of water, he muſt needs have enough, ſuppoſe a man were in the body of the Sun, he muſt needs be ſupplied with light; Now the Soul that comes unto Chriſt, and is in Chriſt, it is in the fountain of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and being in the fountain, it muſt needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a full ſupply, unto all its wants, I ſay a very full ſupply.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To take up one more, I ſay we ſhall have a full ſupply, becauſe, <hi>This ſame Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is communicated and given to Chriſt by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Mediator, for this end and purpoſe, to give out and communicate to us.</hi> For Brethren, this fulneſs that is in Chriſt is communicated unto Chriſt as the fulneſs of the God-head; for it ſeems to be an improper ſpeech to ſay that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the fountain of the Deity, but the Father communicates to the Son in regard of the Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality, now Jeſus Chriſt hath all fulneſs as Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator to communicate and give out, not to keep it to himſelf, and hold it to his own proper uſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, But look now as it is with the Fountain, the Sea hath not its water for it ſelf, but to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate unto rivers, ſo God hath made the Sun to be light, not to be light to it ſelf only, but to communicate and give light to the World: why now there is a full ſupply in Jeſus Chriſt, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filled with all fulneſs, (from the Father) for this end, to give out to others, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; <hi>From his fulneſs we have all received Grace for Grace,</hi> he is full of grace and truth, Ay, but
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:40096:122"/> to what end is he full of grace and truth; that we might receive from his fulneſs grace for grace, and therefore ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>When he aſcended on high he led Captivity Captive, and received gifts for men, even for the rebellious,</hi> He received them for men, for rebellious men, for enemies unto God, to give out and communicate of grace as he was Mediator, and therefore now Jeſus Chriſt gives out grace freely and largely, becauſe it is for that very end he had all fulneſs given to him, ſo that now there is a full ſupply to be had for all that come to Chriſt, Chriſt will fully ſupply all that come to him to drink of the water of life, and he hath never a whit the leſs: And O Brethren that you were fully perſwaded of this truth, that he is the fulneſs of all grace, that ſo we might know whether to go to be ſupplyed in all our ſpiritual wants, for we are ready to go to other things ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to Chriſt, to our <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Duties,</hi> and the like, but theſe are to be uſed <hi>only as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duits, to convey ſuppply to us, but not as the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,</hi> but to look unto Chriſt who hath all ſupplies, that we may go unto him to ſupply us, who only is able to ſupply us, and fill us to the full with all grace, whatſoever we ſtand in need of, and then again, we ſhall not only have a full ſupply, but we ſhall have a ſupply freely, Chriſt will not ask any thing at all of any that comes to him, but they ſhall be ſupplyed freely from his fulneſs; as if you ſhould go to a fountain of water, and be filled, there's none will require or demand any thing of you, ſo the Sun it communicates it's light without money or without price, ſo it is here, when we are ſenſible of our own unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:40096:123"/> and have nothing to carry, and nothing to give, no money, nor no price to carry in our hand, yet may we come to Chriſt, for he is a full fountain, and gives out the water of life free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. I ſhall demonſtrate that Jeſus Chriſt doth give out freely as well as fully, not only fully, but alſo freely, to all that do come unto him for this water of life, that ſo we may be eſtabliſhed in this truth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe, <hi>If it were not ſo, there's no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neither man nor woman, could ever come to drink of this water, if it were not free as well as full,</hi> For no ſinful creature hath any thing to give, that is worth one drop of this water of life, it hath no ability to give any thing, and therefore if it were not free none ſhould partake of it; <hi>Who hath firſt given unto the Lord, and it ſhall be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced him?</hi> who? he means none, <hi>For of him, and through him, and from him are all things, to whom be glory for ever.</hi> And you have the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David</hi> encouraging his people to be liberal in contributing towards the building of the Temple, and they were ſo, inſomuch as <hi>Davids</hi> heart was refreſhed therewithal, ſaith <hi>David, All that we do give, or can communicate,</hi> (though the people have given very liberally) yet ſaith he, <hi>all is thine own,</hi> All that Gold and Silver that we gave for the building of the Temple is all the Lords own, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

And ſo when the Lord gives out any Spiritual good thing, why? what haſt thou to give unto the Lord? yea nothing at all, for what haſt thou that thou haſt not received? not the leaſt drop of good but it is from the Lord; if my life ſhould
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:40096:123"/> ly on it for a drop of living water to be fetcht in of my ſelf, it could not be, or if it were to be had with a good wiſh, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I can neither do nor will any thing,</hi> nay ſaith he, <hi>I am not able to think a good thought,</hi> therefore if my life did ly on it, for one good thought, I ſhould not obtain it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves, to think any thing as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> Yea when we have done all that we are commanded to do or ſuffer, yet this will not purchaſe one drop of it, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10.

               <p n="2">2. Again, <hi>Becauſe of that delight, pleaſure, and complacency, that Jeſus Chriſt doth take in giving out this water of life,</hi> There is never an hungry man takes more delight in eating of his meat, than Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt doth in communicating of this water of life, an hungry man ſhall not need to be bidden to eat his meat, and ſaith Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>My meat is to do the will of him that ſent me,</hi> and ſo he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites all to come unto him; And you Women who know how to give ſuck to your little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they being brought to you and making means; the mother having a full breaſt, ſhall ſhe need to be hired to ſuckle her children? yea ſhe is pained till ſhe be delivered of her fulneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.11 So <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:40096:124"/> Indeed I told you before the Head is the fountain of the animal parts, and the head freely gives out to the ſenſes, and if there be an obſtruction to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the reſt of the members, then it cauſes pain in the head: Why, Jeſus Chriſt he is the head of the body, and he doth as freely, and with as much deſire, and delight, and readineſs, communicate unto any of his members, even as the head is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to communicate unto the body. And ſo you that keep ſhops, what keep you ſhop for? is it not that you deſire to part with your commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties freely for a price? and never any Shopkeeper is more free, and ready to part with any of his commodities for a price, than Jeſus Chriſt is to give out his water of life without price, I <hi>coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel thee to come and buy of me, Rev.</hi> 3.18. (to buy is to receive of him) <hi>to come and buy wine and milk without money and without price, Iſa.</hi> 55.1. Again</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Becauſe of his free invitation to all comers to drink,</hi> He comes among thouſands to proclaim this his readineſs, and freeneſs to give out of this water of life. Suppoſe you ſhould be at a dinner or ſupper at a Friends houſe, and being there ſhould offer for your dinner or ſupper, would not he take it as a diſparagement unto him: why ſo I ſay, if Jeſus Chriſt ſhould require any thing for what he gives out, as a price, and ſhould not give it out freely,, might not theſe many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands that heard of his kind proffer, cry out againſt him? why all thoſe Texts that you read of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he invites poor ſinners to come unto him and that freely, if he were not now free to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, would not theſe words and ſcriptures witneſs

One thing more I ſhould have ſpoken to by way of Anſwer to an Objection, What? are all comers unto Chriſt to be ſupplied? why then, what's the reaſon that ſo many real believers make ſo many complaints, and are under ſuch great wants, they want this, and that, and the other, and ſcarce any but want ſome meaſure or other, ſenſible of their own wants of this grace or the other, and I have ſuch a hard heart, and ſuch a dead heart, and ſuch a carnal heart, how then is it, that if all that do come unto Chriſt ſhall be ſupplyed, what mean theſe complaints?

               <p>AS You have heard, you have here a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous invitation that Jeſus Chriſt doth give unto poor ſinners that ſtand in need of the Water of Life; that ſtand in need of Eternal Life: He makes a loud Proclamation, <hi>If any be a thirſt, let him come unto him.</hi> And you have alſo a gracious Promiſe that is annexed unto this Invitation, <hi>ſc. That they ſhall drink. If any man thirſt let him come unto me and drink.</hi> You have heard the Point opened.</p>
               <p>That any one, whoſoever he be, that comes in a thirſt to Chriſt, ſhall be made to drink abundantly, he ſhall have a full and a free ſupply of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Life.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We have opened and ſhewn what is this ſame coming unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And the laſt day, we came to ſpeak of a <hi>Third,</hi> and that was to ſhew what Chriſt here means in this Promiſe, when he ſaith, <hi>They ſhall drink. If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink.</hi> Ay drink, drink of the Water of Life, drink of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is neceſſary and good, or deſirable for their everlaſting ſalvation; That is meant by this ſame drinking of the Water of Life; Drink in of the Spirit and eternal bleſſedneſs, as you may ſee in the following words; <hi>He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water. This he ſpake of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in this Promiſe here wherein Chriſt ſaith, they ſhall drink; It implies and holds forth two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It holds forth a full ſupply, they ſhall have a full ſupply, not only a taſte or a ſip, but they ſhall drink and have a full draught; they ſhall have their bellys full.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It holds forth and implies, That he will let them have of the Water of Life, and not only ſo, but they ſhall have it freely, they ſhall have a full draught of the Water of Life, a full ſupply with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any price or money; He requires nothing but only coming, if they come they ſhall have it.</p>

                  <p>Why it muſt needs be ſo, that they ſhall have a full ſupply, is, Becauſe that thoſe that come to Chriſt are very near unto him, united to him, and are in him, and ſo no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt; and therefore they muſt needs have a large ſupply and communication from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Suppoſe that a man were in the Sun, the very fountain of light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he be near the Sun he hath much light, but if he be in the Sun, then a more large fulneſs of light; and ſo they that come unto Chriſt, they are neer Chriſt, they are nigh unto him, <hi>John</hi> 6.56. <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him,</hi> He abides in me, and dwells in me.

                  <p>Again, This full ſupply that is given out unto Believers, it is given out not only fully but freely, Saith Chriſt, I do not ask any thing at all, but whoſoever comes he ſhall have his fill, he ſhall have a full ſupply, and that freely, he ſhall drink and that freely, only do but come, and you ſhall drink, and thy ſoul ſhall live, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.17. <hi>And
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:40096:127"/> Whoſoever will let him come and drink of the water of life freely,</hi> And ſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat, yea come, buy wine and milk without money, and without price;</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any price at all, it is only coming, and that to every one that comes to him, it's moſt free. You have had two or three Demonſtrations, (I ſhall but briefly name them and ſo proceed) to ſhew and ſatisfy your hearts in this, that Jeſus Chriſt requireth nothing of any ſoul that comes to him, for the giving out of a large ſupply.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If Chriſt ſhould require any thing, and ſhould not give out freely, there is not a ſoul that ever was in the World, or ever ſhall be in the World, that had or hath wherewith to purchaſe any thing, or any one drop of the water of life: For we cannot as much as will, or think, or ſpeak of our ſelves, not ſo much as to have a good thought. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Jeſus Chriſt will have it ſo, becauſe it is his pleaſure and delight.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It muſt needs be ſo, becauſe of that Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Jeſus Chriſt doth here make unto poor ſouls that come unto him.

                  <p>Do we ſay there is ſuch a fulneſs in Jeſus Chriſt? and will he give out a large and full ſupply unto all that come to him, and that freely? How
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:40096:127"/> can this ſtand with the experience of them that are true believers that truly come unto Jeſus Chriſt? They are ſo ſenſible of their own wants, weakneſſes, and their own defects of grace, as what more frequent complaints? and who do more frequently complain than true believers? And there is never a true believing ſoul that comes to Jeſus Chriſt, but is ſenſible of ſome defect or want, or other, and hath not attained to perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the more, and nearer he comes to Chriſt, ſtill the more ſenſible of his defects and wants: O! none ſo weak as I am, none ſo poor in grace as I am, none ſo weak in faith, ſo wanting in love, in humility, in patience, and in meekneſs as I, and O! none hath ſuch a cold heart, ſuch a dead heart, ſuch an unfruitful heart as I have: You will ſay, where is this ſame full ſupply then? Shall all that come to Chriſt have a full ſupply? how can theſe things be? What ſhall we ſay then? that thoſe that make ſuch complaints as theſe are not true believers? no, God forbid. Or ſhall we ſay that this Truth that Jeſus Chriſt hath ſpoken is not truth? why? where is then this ſame full ſupply? how can this ſtand to be a truth? that all that do come to Jeſus Chriſt ſhall have a full ſupply, and ſhall drink abundantly, and ſhall drink freely, when he ſaith, <hi>Every one that cometh unto me ſhall drink of the water of life,</hi> and that freely. Do not many believers fear that their ſins will be their ruine? and fear condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſometimes? Now how doth this ſtand with this full ſupply, which is to be had in Chriſt?

                  <p>You will ſay, The Saints have not a full draught and full ſupply, becauſe they complain, I anſwer, that though here they be in a ſtate of imperfection, and ſtand in need of a daily ſupply, (being ſenſible of their own defects and weakneſſes) <hi>Yet every believing ſoul hath drunk ſo much of the water of life, as now he hath right and title unto the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Glory,</hi> where there is ſuch fulneſs of joy, as he ſhall be ſatisfied, and ſhall not be able to deſire any more, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. <hi>Thou wilt ſhew me the path of life, in thy preſence is fulneſs of Joy, and at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> They ſhall have joy as much as they can hold, every veſſel ſhall be filled with glory ſo full as it can hold no more, they ſhall enjoy as much as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they are able to hold or containe, every veſſel ſhall be full of glory. The beginnings of eternal life are here, and though poſſibly they may be made to drink tears here in abundance, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they have the beginnings of eternal life and glory, and when they come once to enjoy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of it, they ſhall not be able to deſire one draught, one jot more, ſo, <hi>He that believeth on me, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſpringing up unto eternal life.</hi> So much for that Objection.

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:40096:129"/> this Application ſhall be to preſs this Invitation of Jeſus Chriſt. Be it known unto you Men and Women, young men and old, and children, that are capable of knowledge, Know it, that Jeſus Chriſt doth invite every one of you that ſtands before him in this Ordinance, to come unto him and draw water out of this Well of ſalvation. It is a ſtrong invitation that whoſoever comes to him ſhall drink of this water of life; Let me ſay unto you as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid unto the Children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.46. <hi>And he ſaid unto them, Set your hearts unto all the Words that</hi> I <hi>teſtify among you this day,</hi> Set your hearts to this Invitation of Jeſus Chriſt, to the Word that is now ſounding in your ears, for it is your life, Jeſus Chriſt doth bring eternal life to your doors, to your hearts, do not look upon them as if they were words of courſe and wind, as if there were no truth or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in them.</p>

Suppoſe now, that Jeſus Chriſt were here preſent ſpeaking theſe words, as he did with his own mouth in the hearing of thouſands, and ſuppoſe now, that if Jeſus Chriſt were here in his bodily preſence, do you not think you ſhould believe? and give entertainment to what he ſpake? behold Jeſus Chriſt now ſpeaks in his

Know, Jeſus Chriſt holds forth all this, whatſoever is requiſite to eternal life, Jeſus Chriſt doth invite you to this, and holds forth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to give a full draught of it to all that ever will come to him; Therefore let no poor ſoul lay impediments and blocks in its own way to hinder him from coming unto Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

Jeſus Chriſt invites ſuch poor ſouls as have nothing at all, no ability at all, a poor blind creature, if one be more blind and unable, and more ignorant than another, here is the invitation, that Jeſus Chriſt doth make this day to ſuch a poor ſoul, that he ſhall, if he come, he ſhall drink, and he ſhall have of this Water of Life.</p>

                  <p>To open this a little. This ſame coming to Chriſt (I would ſpeak it as plainly as poſſibly I could, and not as a riddle, or fancy, or notion) 'Tis an hearkening to Chriſt in a Word of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and the ſoul is therein to venture it ſelf, and rely on or upon him in that Word which he holds
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:40096:134"/> forth, and when the ſoul doth venture and cloſe with all, this is now a coming unto Chriſt; when the Lord gives out an invitation, a gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which holds out mercy and eternal life, and in the hearing of it the Lord perſwades the ſoul of the truth and reality of it, it is perſwaded to truſt in it, to rely upon it, and to expect an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment and performance of it. And becauſe I would not ſpeak it as mine own words alone, I ſpeak it as the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> did when the Angel came to her, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.38. <hi>Then ſaid Mary, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Servant of the Lord, be it unto me accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to thy Word:</hi> This was now a believing, a truſting, and a relying on the Word of the Lord, ſhe was a Virgin, and the Angel anſwered her in that, as ſhe had no more to ſay, but to rely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Word of Promiſe, <hi>Behold the Handmaid of the Lord, be it unto me according to thy Word;</hi> whence was it? it was from this ſpeech, the holy confidence and expectation of the fulfilling of that promiſe to her. And ſo, effectual calling is an hearkening unto the Lords call, the ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſwaded to receive the Word, cloſing with, returning anſwer to the Word, then the ſoul is effectually called. So alſo there is an ineffectual Call, unto which the ſoul doth not anſwer, but looks upon the Word of the Lord by his Servants, as words of wind, and words of courſe, but as this ſame accepting of this gracious invitation, and promiſe which he holds forth, is effectual calling, why ſo, the neglecting of theſe, I ſay, is a refuſing to hear him that ſpeaks from Heaven. Take heed that you do not refuſe him that ſpeaks from Heaven, that is, now when the Lord
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:40096:134"/> ſpeaks in his invitation by gifts and outward call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; this invitation being propounded and made, and men make light of, it is an ineffectual calling; ſo now when upon the invitation of the call of the Lord in his promiſe, there is an yielding obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience unto that call in faith, it's called the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.26. When the ſoul doth yield unto the Lord in the voice of the Promiſe, cloſe withal, and receive and embrace it, looking upon it as worthy of all acceptation, receiving it with both hands, as it were; when the ſoul doth thus venture to rely upon the Word, venturing it ſelf upon the Lord in his Promiſe, that if I periſh, I will periſh there, I will venture my ſelf upon the Lords Word and Faithfulneſs. This is effectual Calling, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, in whom I have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and I am perſwaded, that he will keep that good thing which I have committed unto him againſt that day;</hi> I have committed my ſoul concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments unto him, and I truſt them in his armes. When the ſoul doth venture thus upon the gracious Word of invitation, doth receive it, and committeth it ſelf unto the Lord in it, this is a cloſing with Chriſt, and the anwer of the heart unto the Lords call; and this is a coming unto Chriſt. So that when you ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon the Lord in his Word, you cloſe with him in it, it is ſoon ſaid, yea ſoon done, the ſoul may come, and cloſe with Chriſt in the Promiſe, and that ſoon too, ſo paſs from death unto life: Therefore ask your own hearts in the Preſence of the Lord, ſeeing Jeſus Chriſt doth make ſuch a gracious Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:40096:135"/> for to come unto him, and venture upon him in his Word, whether it can be free and ready to ſay, now Lord let it be according to thy Word to me: ſay in this manner, as in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, Lord, upon this gracious invitation of thine in the Goſpel, I deſire to reſt and hope upon the faithfulneſs of thy Word, and to accept thereof, and truſt in it; Can you ſay it in the preſence of the Lord, you, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you are that ſeem to be afar off, though poſſibly you might have had ſome glimmering hopes, hoping ſometimes, that the Lord would be merciful to you, and preſently fearing your eternal condition. Well, I ſpeak it to you that are old men and women, and poſſibly old ſinners, that have lived in ſin all your lives long, and poſſibly are even hopeleſs in your ſelves, and ready to caſt out words of deſpair, and ſo in a hopeleſs condition in your ſelves, to you the Lord this day calls to come in unto him, and to hearken to this invitation, and if you now come unto him, you ſhall have of the water of life. And you young Men and Maids, (I would leave out none, who are capable of partaking of this water of life) conſider the Queſtion again, Are you willing to be ſaved? Let your hearts ſpeak it out between the Lord and your own ſouls, upon this Word of thy grace unto which thou haſt invited me, this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Promiſe, I do now commit my ſoul to thee, and rely upon this thy Word of Grace, and rely upon thy faithfulneſs to accompliſh it to me; and have your ſouls thus anſwered unto the Lord? let it be unto me according
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:40096:135"/> to thy Word: let me ſay it in the name of the Lord unto you, This day is ſalvation come unto thy ſoul, this day hath Jeſus Chriſt given eternal life unto thy ſoul, this day the Lord hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thee into Covenant with himſelf, and hath vouchſafed thee to be his. And I ſpeak it in the authority which Jeſus Chriſt hath given me in his word, even every one that thus comes to Chriſt, accepting of this his gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, I ſay it, thy ſins are forgiven thee, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon him in the Faithfulneſs of his Word, and Promiſe, I ſay, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath forgiven thy ſins, and you may go home, and record it for a Memorial, that this day, at ſuch a time, the Lord hath drawn out my ſoul, to make a cloſe with himſelf; and now eternal life is come unto thee, the Lord hath forgiven thy ſins, and now thou art paſſed from death to life. Let me make the offer again unto ſuch poor ſinners as have held out all this time, and have not laid hold upon this gracious invitation, made by Jeſus Chriſt, that will yet venture the Lord, perſwading your hearts, though poſſibly you have been enemies, and oppoſers, and poſſibly might come to oppoſe and catch, and though never ſo far off, and loſt in your ſelves, yet notwithſtanding hearken to this invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if the Lord doth perſwade your hearts to ſay ſolemnly and ſeriouſly, Lord, upon this Word of thy gracious Promiſe and Invitation, I do now deſire to truſt and to venture upon thy Word, and do expect the performance and accompliſhment of thy Word,

                  <p>It is ſaid that the Eunuch went away rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, after that <hi>Philip</hi> was caught away by the Spirit, and ſo hath every Believer cauſe to do.</p>

                  <p>Another Word is, <hi>That you would go unto God with a holy boldneſs, as to your God and Father, for ſuch ſpecial mercies, as you deſire to have at the Lords hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Seek the Lord, while he may be found, and draw nigh unto him, while he is near.</hi> The Lord is near to you, do do you draw neer to him with a humble and holy boldneſs, as to your God and Father, and you may ask what you will, and now beg that the Lord would eſtabliſh his Work of Grace in your hearts, and now ask for this and that mercy, and for your relations, even what you will.

                  <p>Look that you do not walk as the Gentiles did, in the vanity of your minds, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.17.
